*Narrator:*
*Castles in Spain, a serial in five parts by Edward Boyd, with Ray Brooks as Graham Mayer.*
*Graham Mayer is visited one day in his London bookshop by a girl called Teresa, who takes him to see her grandfather, Sandy Forrest. Forrest was once an officer with the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War. Now, fifty years later, he wants Mayer to track down, not a rare book, but a missing person, an old comrade from Spain called Jock Cameron.*
*But as Mayer leaves Forrest's house to think about this unusual request, he's met in the hall by an elderly blind man.*

Is that you, Mayer?
Yes, Mr. Colman.
Have you come to any arrangement?
Well, not exactly.
May I ask why not?
Perhaps I have reservations about the whole thing.
I am delighted to hear you say that.
Why?
Jock Cameron was a man of violence, and wherever he was, death was not far away.
I think, Mayer, that it would be better for everyone concerned if Cameron were never found.
I came out of the quiet, prosperous house into the quiet, prosperous street and walked quickly away, not feeling prosperous, not feeling quiet, but in some undefined way disturbed, and yes, resentful.
Two old men and a teenage girl had, in their various ways, called into question everything I had not realised I was.
Not being very well up in car recognition or the subtleties of ABC registrations and stuff like that, I took no notice of the car that pulled in just ahead of me, until I saw the driver.
You walk very fast.
I always do when I'm afraid.
What are you afraid of?
I'm afraid of the law to be seen actually walking in this neighbourhood.
Jump in before the lynching party arrives.
Where to?
Back to the shop.
You live there as well? Or are you a workaholic?
I'm not a workaholic. I do live above the shop.
Sounds very old-fashioned to me.
It's a crown property.
What does that mean?
When I get a burst pipe or block drain or something like that, I put a call through to Buck House and they send somebody along.
A prince of the blood, of course.
If there's one available.
Cool. Very cool.
The evening had settled in, wrapping the city in leisure like a duvet.
Musicians were coalescing into orchestras, while in half a hundred dressing rooms, actors and actresses smeared reality with grease paint.
Cars slid past, bearing passengers, transformed for the night into penguins or perfumed peons.
Critics rattled epigrams in their pockets like loose change, hoping that the magic of a clever phrase would change banality into something handed down from Mount Sinai.
A new playwright wondered if she was about to become the genius of the week.
It was the hour of the theatre.
How did you get on with Grandfather?
You were right when you said he was devious.
So what else is new?
Yes.
Did you agree to do what he asked?
I told him I would tell him my answer, yes or no, tomorrow.
You'll say yes, of course.
Why of course?
Because I recommended you as the right man for the job.
What made you do that?
Intuition.
How very old-fashioned of you.
What a devious crowd you are.
Not all of us.
Yes, all of you. Every last one of you.
Sorry?
Your grandfather spent his time trying to destroy the credibility of my grandmother.
Successfully?
What the hell does that matter?
Don't be cross.
I have every right to be cross. Your grandfather wants me to do something. Fine.
But he wraps up that simple fact in all kinds of pseudo-psychological claptrap.
I told him you were more intelligent than you looked.
Oh, great. That makes everything all right, then.
I could have said you were a load of rubbish. Would you have preferred that?
My preference doesn't appear to matter.
Oh, dear.
Your vanity's been hurt.
Wrong. My intelligence has been insulted.
You can't even get your act together, you lot.
You reckon?
Why don't you take a vote on it?
A vote on what?
Do you want Jock Cameron found,
or would he be better off left wherever he is?
We want him found, of course.
Coleman doesn't.
How do you know that?
He told me.
Ironical, isn't it?
What is?
Your grandfather wasting all the sweetness and light on me.
Was it wasted?
I'm afraid it was.
So I've got to go back and report failure?
Not failure. Success.
You like playing bloody silly games, don't you?
No, no.
I neither like playing them or having them played on me,
which is why I intend to find
Jock Cameron.
What exactly does that mean?
It means that I'm not impressed by your grandfather's reasons
for wanting to find Cameron,
but I'm fascinated by the possibility
of discovering why Coleman
doesn't want him found.
We finished the journey in silence,
but it was not a hostile silence.
I felt that momentarily I had ceased to exist,
but that what I had said to her
still buzzed in her brain,
the words unwelcome as picnic insects.
She dropped me off at the shop
and acknowledged my thanks with the bright, automatic smile
that a well-brought-up lady confers
on someone who has just opened a door for her.
And I found myself wondering
if in some unknown way
I had done just that.
I collected a bundle of books
about the Spanish Civil War
and took them up to bed with me.
I thought and thought about Cameron.
I fell asleep,
still thinking of him.
Then the dream came.
And in the dream,
a tough little man strutted through
a landscape of harsh brown bitterness.
He had no face,
yet somehow
he was whistling.
Cameron? Jock Cameron?
Who goes there?
Friend.
Advance, friend, and be recognized.
I do not recognize you, friend.
Then do not claim the name.
You claimed it first.
Would you know my skin on a bush in Palestine?
Yes.
That is a privilege dearly bought.
The price was paid.
Where?
Arama.
Was the final payment made there?
Permission to speak?
Granted.
I've changed my mind.
You cannot do that.
Who says so?
King's regulations.
I'm a Republican.
You are welcome to this land, Republican.
This land whose sun has burned green
from the spectrum.
This land of tasteless bread
and bitter oranges.
Cameron?
Here we have everything a bad humanity requires.
Cameron!
I want to talk to you.
I awoke from my dream's confusion
to sunlight
and the kind of morning
that summer had been aiming at for months
and had finally achieved too late.
I lay for a while
savoring the rest
of the autumn to come.
Shock-headed chrysanthemums,
the acrid smell of burning leaves,
old men in the park,
bonfires.
And at that moment I heard the telephone ring.
I do hope I've got the right number.
I'm sure we can work something out between us.
Let me explain.
Put me out of my misery first.
Yes?
Who should I be?
It would be very reassuring if you were a Mr Mayer.
Be reassured.
I do believe it's working.
Six out of six is good, isn't it?
Anything better would be suspicious.
I'll be round in about ten minutes, Mr Mayer.
Hello?
Hello?
He was as good as his word
and ten minutes later
he walked into the shop.
A tall young man whose excessive good looks
were cancelled out by the vulnerability.
His dazzling smile
had paid for some dentist's holiday
in sunny Tenerife.
His voice was standard RP
and every now and then
you felt it belonged elsewhere
and to someone else.
I said ten minutes, Mr Mayer
and here I am, bang on time.
Punctuality is the politeness of princes.
Couldn't agree more.
You have a nice line in telephone calls.
Thank you.
Six out of six what?
Oh, that, it's too embarrassing.
It'll go no further than this room.
Well, you see, Mr Mayer,
I can't remember lines.
Maybe you should stick to mime.
It's not funny, Mr Mayer, I can tell you.
What has this got to do with telephone calls?
Memory training.
Memory training? Right.
I'm sure there's a connection there somewhere
if I could only make it.
It works like this.
At one time if anyone gave me their telephone number
I used to write it down.
Now I make an effort to remember it.
And you find that improves your memory?
Six out of six.
You haven't told me your name.
Arnold.
Hathaway Arnold.
Oh, splendid name for an actor.
You really think so?
Yes, fine Shakespearean ring to it.
That's why I chose it.
My real name is Murgatroyd.
Well, now that's out of the way, what brings you here?
I've come to take over.
Would you mind saying that again?
I've come to take over.
Are you talking about this bookshop?
Yes.
I don't usually make that kind of mistake.
Ah, Theresa.
How would you like to indulge in some more memory training?
What do you want me to do?
I want you to call Theresa
and pass on this simple, brutal message.
Tell her I'm fed up with her
and our whole family, past and present.
And that goes for any future members of the family still to come.
Suppose she wants to know why?
She won't.
I don't think I can do this, Mr. Mayer.
Nonsense. You're an actor, aren't you?
Yes.
And went round the corner to a little cafe
that was an interesting survival
in that the proprietor stubbornly believed
that fast food was no food at all
but merely a noun
contradicted by an adjective.
He had weird ideas about music, too,
believing, as he did,
that the best accompaniment to meals
was silence.
I sat there for about an hour
and read one of the heavy newspapers
that told me what the intellectual yuppies
were wearing, thinking,
peddling that particular day.
Thus refreshed,
physically and mentally,
I returned to the shop
and Hathaway Arnold,
whose real name was Murgatroyd.
You have to meet her at the airport.
There has to be more than that, Arnold.
Honestly, Mr. Mayer...
You passed on my message. Word for word.
And she made no comment? None.
All she said was that you were booked
on a four o'clock flight
and that she'd meet you at the airport.
Well, I thought you would know that.
Why?
I don't know. Just took it for granted, I suppose.
Is it me, Arnold?
Tell me, is it me?
Is what you, Mr. Mayer?
Am I walking around with an aura
that everybody can see clearly except myself?
A big, blazing, multicoloured aura
that proclaims to the world, sucker?
Can I answer that in my own way?
Please do.
She's sending a car to take you to the airport.
Not far from the checking-in desk,
she was standing, remote and cool,
and for what the word is worth nowadays,
virginal.
She looked at me
as though I reminded her
of someone she'd once met
at a rather boring party.
Better check in.
Would it be too much to ask you where I'm going?
You're going to Glasgow.
Why?
According to the PR men, Glasgow is miles better.
Better than what?
You know what Robert Louis Stevenson said?
I'll give him two minutes.
He said the wise man travels only in imagination.
So?
I have the feeling of being forced to travel in someone else's.
You're a fantasy merchant.
Maybe it takes one to know one.
Look, are you going or are you not?
Then get going.
I've brought you a briefcase.
In it, you'll find everything you need.
Have a nice day.
And with that pious wish,
she vanished into thin air
or more accurately
into the thick, artificial,
controlled airport air
that smelt of everywhere and nowhere,
of tourists and terrorists
and have a good day.
I checked in
and my obedience was rewarded
by a boarding pass
that entitled me to a free diagnosis
by a machine that certified me
as free of guns and bombs
and other hidden hatreds.
And thus driven,
I boarded a plane that waited pale and patient
like a beached whale
anxious to escape the predators of earth
even if that meant taking to the air.
About six miles above the earth,
I opened the briefcase Teresa had given me.
It contained various sheets of paper,
one of which appeared to be a list of addresses.
Another said that a reservation
had been made for me
at a Glasgow hotel.
There were four or five tattered postcards
and there was money,
always a handy thing to have
even at 36,000 feet.
I put everything back in the briefcase
and the little man in the seat beside me
gave me an approving smile.
It does my heart good to see that.
I beg your pardon?
I once flew from New York
with a man who kept working a pocket calculator all the way.
You should have complained to the pilot.
I got drunk instead.
And objectionable, I hope.
Oh, not my style, I'm afraid.
Are you a professional, ma'am?
I run a bookshop.
Oh, very interesting.
You or secondhand books?
Both.
I had a great aunt once who wrote a book.
Really?
The man was a man in a soporific way
and eventually
he sent himself off to sleep.
And the aircraft roared
towards the north
with its comatose passengers,
peas in a 600 miles an hour pod.
And the pilot told us
it was raining in Glasgow
but we decided to land there anyway
and we did.
A taxi took me to the hotel
which seemed to have as many flags
as a small wall.
From my room on the seventh floor
there was a view of the river
and the ceaseless rain
neither particularly interesting.
So I took the papers
out of the briefcase
and gave them a second look
at the list of names and addresses
at the five tattered postcards
which had been posted
from various parts of the country
which were all in the same handwriting
and which were all signed
Jock.
So I decided to phone
the top number of the list
in the briefcase.
Valleyfield Residential Home?
My name is Mayer.
I wonder if you can help me.
What seems to be the problem Mr. Mayer?
I'd like to come and have a word
with one of your residents.
Which resident have you in mind?
Mr. Henderson.
Yes, we do have a Mr. Henderson here.
Are you a relative?
A friend of a friend.
The normal visiting hours are between 7 and 8.
I'll come along then.
Very well.
I need hardly remind you of our regulations
concerning tobacco and alcohol.
Valleyfield Residential Home
was an anorexic building
three stories high
with a patch of lawn in front
that was no bigger than a boy's size billiard table
if not as smooth.
The ground floor rooms
two of them fronting onto the street
were chauvinistic
with tartan curtains
and there was a strong smell of cats
and disinfectant
with neither odour predominating.
At 7 o'clock a bell rang
and we were turned loose
and a surly nurse with varicose veins
conducted me to a small room
where a man called Henderson
lay in bed.
He was about 80
with the complexion of a sound
polished apple.
He had hair as soft as silk
and his eyes were
astonishingly blue.
Well, Mr. Mayer.
Can we talk in private?
Right, Bertha. You heard what the man said.
Two's company, three's an epidemic.
Oh, Mr. Henderson.
She didn't seem to want to go.
A nosy bugger.
Now, what was it you couldn't discuss
in front of witnesses?
Nothing.
Oh? That won't take long.
I've, um, I've brought you a present.
Tell me something first.
Yes?
Do I know you?
You probably knew my grandfather.
Who was he?
Mayer. Augustus Mayer.
Oh, it rings a bell.
Harama. February, 1937.
Killed there, was he?
Yes.
Something was said about a present.
Something was indeed.
Is it whisky or fags?
What would you say to whisky and fags?
Oh, I'd say that was version and overkill.
Well, let's just say
it's in memory of an old comrade.
Aye.
It sees one of the plastic cups.
Right.
That's a drop of the real stuff.
Do you mind me asking you a few questions?
No fire away.
First of all,
let me tell you who I am
and what I'm doing here.
Oh, you've already told me who you are.
You're Big Gus Mayer's grandson
and that's good enough for me.
As for the other thing,
what you're doing here,
for you, you'll be like the others.
What others?
Is there a wee taste of that whisky?
Yes.
Well, there's these two kids
that come to see me every Sunday morning.
Yeah.
Cheers. Cheers.
Aye, there's two of them.
A boy and a girl.
And the way things are nowadays,
the boy's the one with the long hair.
What do they talk about?
They're never short of subjects,
I can tell you that.
Worthwhile subjects?
Oh, it depends what you think is worthwhile.
All done men like me.
You think that's how they see you?
No.
They're not doing me a favour
that boots on the other foot.
In what way?
I think I represent something
that they feel they've lost.
Do they ever say anything like that?
No.
Maybe they've lost the words for it
as well as the thing itself.
Do you remember a man
called Jock Cameron in Spain?
Well, I'll be damned.
What's the matter?
I was just talking about him the other day.
Who was asking you about him?
These two kids I was telling you about
who come here on Sundays.
They decided to turn the Spanish Civil War
into a project.
Not very original.
Why do you say that?
Hitler and Mussolini had the same idea.
Oh, so they did.
Maybe the kids will be lucky.
Oh, man.
I could have went on all day about him
and they would have asked for me.
You'd have thought I was talking
about some big pop star
and not a wee hard man from Coatbridge.
Did you keep in touch after Spain?
No.
Was there a reason for that?
Maybe it was because
we thought we had failed.
You don't believe that, do you?
If I believed that, Mayer,
then your grandfather died in vain.
If I believed that, Mayer,
I could never swear to you
on the stack of Bibles
that in the same circumstances
I would do it all again.
I envy you.
I don't care a bugger whether you do or not
because that wasn't my reason
for doing what I did.
Mr Henderson.
Thank you very much for your wish, Jay.
Good night to you, Mayer.
Walking away
from the Valleyfield residential home,
I decided that Mr Henderson
did not get my vote
as Geriatric of the Year.
And that seemed fair enough
since I suspected
that I didn't rate too highly
on his list of people
he could not do without.
And brooding on this
took me through the damp streets
all the way back to the hotel.
MUSIC PLAYS
I let myself into my room
only to fetch up short inside the door
and stare astonished at the stranger
who stared back at me
from beside the window
with a kind of defiant embarrassment.
Er, look, I know this must seem
very unusual.
I'm glad we agree about that.
This matter seemed so very urgent.
First things first.
Who are you?
My name is
Nora McGill.
How did you manage to get in here?
One of the maids let me in.
Charming. How much did it cost you?
Nothing.
Oh, come on now.
I told her you were my boyfriend.
All the world loves a lover.
What happens now?
I think
I'll call the police.
Oh!
What's so funny?
I am the police.
MUSIC PLAYS
Aren't you going to ask to see my warrant card?
When I get my breath back.
Have a look at it anyway.
Seems all right.
I suppose these things can be forged.
Well, you know about forgeries.
Less than nothing.
Have you a passport?
Yes. Would you mind showing it to me?
It's at home. And where is home?
London.
Quite sure it's not Dublin?
Positive.
I've never even been there.
Our information tells a different story.
Then your information is nonsense.
What are you doing up here?
Very cooperative, Hanrahan.
There could be a very simple reason for that.
Could indeed.
I'm no expert in these things, but don't you lot usually hunt in pairs?
My partner stepped outside for a minute.
Get a fresh pair of thumbscrews, no doubt.
No doubt.
Why didn't you just call room service?
Better open up then, shall we?
This is Inspector McNeil, special branch.
Glad you could drop in, Inspector.
Perhaps you'll explain to me why you did.
A slight misunderstanding, Mr Mayer.
Not much of an explanation,
but at least you got my name right.
Part of the misunderstanding, sir.
Why did your partner call me Hanrahan?
Maybe because she doesn't know what Hanrahan looks like.
Do you?
That's the problem, Mr Mayer.
Nobody knows what Hanrahan looks like.
Are you a patriot, Mr Mayer?
Not a very loud one.
You disappoint me.
Why? What are you expecting?
Something more bookish, perhaps.
Patriotism is a last refuge of a scoundrel.
My partner has an honours degree in English.
I'm suitably impressed.
You still haven't answered the question.
Oh, but I have. It may not be the answer you wanted,
but it's still an answer.
Bit flippant, wasn't it?
And you'd rather I was bookish?
Well, you are a bookseller, aren't you?
Have you checked that out?
Of course. Just now.
I think it was G.K. Chesterton
who best stated my own particular attitude,
my kind of patriotism, if you like.
Instead, my country, right or wrong,
is like saying my mother drunk or sober.
Is that sufficiently bookish for you?
Up to a point.
Well, if there's no further business,
will you both get the hell out of here
and let me have my room back?
There's just one more thing, Mr Mayer.
Let's hear it, then.
Remember, nobody knows what this Hanrahan looks like.
Nobody knows what name he's travelling under.
So keep your door locked.
And don't let anyone in you don't know.
