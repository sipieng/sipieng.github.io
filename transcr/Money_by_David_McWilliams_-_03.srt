In April 1694, things weren't looking great for a hell-raising Scot, John Law. He'd blown his inheritance on gambling and possibly other delights of the night. His disappointed mother had to bail him out, and now he was going to break the news to her that he had just killed a man. Only 23, John Law was doomed, or was he?

Law had killed Edmund Wilson in a duel with a lunge of a sword to the belly. Apparently Law and Wilson loved the same woman, Betty Villiers, who was also the King's lover. But Law sidestepped the hangman in one of the many improbable scrapes of his life. Murderer, gambler, philanderer, art collector, casino impresario, seducer of women, and general all-round good-time Charlie, the father of monetary economics, was far from the dull stereotypical economist. In time, he would revolutionise money itself, and his legacy is scrawled like intellectual graffiti all over present-day central banking.

John Law was the father of what would become known as fiat money, from the Latin to let it be done, which is money issued by central banks that is not tied to gold. Law's system was constrained only by trust, and, as we will see, the man who slipped the noose also wanted to set money free.

Law's defence against the murder charge was that it was a simple crime of passion. But there is another, more titillating possibility, which is that Law was hired as a hitman. Many years later, in 1723, an alternative and scurrilous explanation for Wilson's luxurious lifestyle emerged in a pamphlet suggesting that Wilson had been kept by a male lover, a nobleman who allegedly had become tired of Wilson. In this story, the killing of Edmund was a simple hit, and John Law was the paid assassin. Letters hint that the nobleman in question was a fellow called Charles Spencer, the third Earl of Sunderland, a direct ancestor of Winston Churchill, Princess Diana and Prince William.

Now if this hypothesis is correct, and the evidence is somewhat circumstantial, then the men most directly involved in the killing of Edmund Wilson on Bloomsbury Heath were John Law and Charles Spencer, and 26 years later, at the height of the stock market bubbles, these two possible criminal accomplices would meet again.

Documents show that the government arranged Law's escape from prison in 1694. Having friends in high places can come in handy, especially if you have information that might compromise them. Law spent the next decade travelling through France, Holland and Italy, and he used his mathematical skills, first noticed at school in Scotland, to make a fortune in the casinos of Europe. But getting rich wasn't enough, and while gaming gave him a rich lifestyle, banking and the possibilities of paper money intrigued him.

And despite being a convicted murderer, still technically on the run, the Scotsman sent a plan for a completely new banking system based on paper money to Lord Godolphin, the English Lord High Treasurer. This 1704 proposal is remarkably modern in tone. In early 18th century Europe there was always a squeeze on money because people wanted the reassurance of gold and silver underpinning the value of cash. For Law, this was a failure of imagination. What if he could come up with another base for his new paper money?

Now at this stage his thinking was that that base should be land, the traditional source of all income in pre-industrial societies, which was a stable and reasonably liquid asset. For Law there was an obvious connection between the amount of money available in the economy and the growth rate. This connection represented a major step forward in economic theory. The nub of his thinking was that a supply of new money would generate economic energy and vibrancy, creating an increased demand for money. From Law's idea flows all modern central bank thinking. Even today the Federal Reserve's mandate to manage the money supply and achieve both growth and inflation objectives stems directly from Law's observations.

Godolphin rejected Law's proposal, but Law got his breakthrough in France. The Sun King Louis XIV, who had died in 1715, had almost bankrupted the country. France faced two crises. One was a shortage of silver and gold, and the other one was a very high level of state indebtedness.

To address the first crisis, Law, as Comptroller General of Finances, suggested replacing metallic money in the form of gold and silver with paper money issued by a new bank, the General Bank, which was established in May 1716. Modelled on the Bank of England, the new bank would coax France's richest nobles to buy its shares. Law omitted to tell the world that the two largest shareholders were himself and the Regent. This private bank, operating under royal charter, then issued paper money. And initially this paper money was fully convertible into gold and silver, but later it would only be backed by the state's bona fides, financed by tax revenues to the state.

The General Bank solved France's first problem. As new paper money circulated freely in the economy, this stimulated France's traders, entrepreneurs and business folk. To address the national debt, Law, having observed gamblers in the casino, came up with the idea of a massive debt-for-equity swap. In simple language, this means betting on tomorrow to solve the problems of today. In the early 18th century, tomorrow, or the future, was the new world, which promised untold profits.

What might happen if Law could enlist tens of thousands of French people into the potential of the colonies via the sale of shares in a company? With the money raised by selling the shares, Law's scheme could then pay off the national debt. In August 1717, Law took over the Compagnie d'Occident, the Company of the West, which had been given monopoly trading rights by the King over French Louisiana. French Louisiana, which was not the same as the present state of Louisiana, was almost half the size of the USA today. It was an enormous tract of fertile land ready to be harvested and mined.

With the Company of the West, Law put his debt-for-equity idea into place, offering existing holders of government debt a swap, their French government IOUs, for the new company's shares. Law made the shares available at a deep discount. This meant that the shares would bounce on purchase and the winners would brag about their new riches, persuading more reticent owners of government debt to have a flutter.

Law glued the state onto his ventures by persuading the Regent to turn the General Bank into the Government's Bank, meaning the formerly private bank was nationalised. From this point, all taxes were paid to, and all state spending dispersed from, this bank. In 1718, as the Company of the West continued to expand, the General Bank was renamed the Royal Bank. The Crown and the murderer were now in it together.

The parent company became known as the Mississippi Company, a sufficiently vague name for an entity that covered everything from sugar to slave trading. The sheer magnitude of Law's operation was breathtaking. Law had succeeded in turning the country into a boom-time economy brimming with paper money and speculation.

Not to be outdone, Britain introduced a copycat to the Mississippi Company in January 1720 when the South Sea Company proposed to take over most of British government debt. This proposal was accepted by our old friend the Earl of Sunderland, Charles Spencer, the man who allegedly hired Law to kill Edmund Wilson and who now was Britain's first Lord of the Treasury. Exchange Alley in London hosted the world's second stock market boom, the South Sea Bubble, with enormous crowds flocking to purchase shares not only in this South Sea Company but in a whole variety of bubble companies with charters that varied from the series to the bizarre, including a company that produced square cannonballs.

Back in France the market began to wobble. Law was facing an Emperor's New Clothes moment. Various reasons have been cited for triggering the wobble, ranging from a plague in Marseilles to inflation taking off in busy French ports. Whatever the catalyst, buyers panicked and disappeared and their place was taken by desperate sellers. In panic everybody wanted gold, nobody wanted to touch Law's paper promises. In December, not for the first time, Law was forced to flee a country.

After the South Sea Bubble's collapse in England in 1720, Charles Spencer was brought before the House of Commons and charged with using South Sea shares to bribe politicians and members of George I's entourage, including, yet again, the King's mistress. After a stormy debate, Spencer was acquitted. Once again, the lives of Charles Spencer and John Law were mired in money, mistresses, maybe not murder but certainly malfeasance.

Despite the collapse in the Mississippi Company, Law's innovations laid the foundation for the form of money we use today. And this was Law's legacy. Money issued by the central bank on behalf of the state, deriving its strength from the institutional credibility of the state and, indirectly, made whole by the state's tax revenue. Law showed that money could be unchained from gold and silver, foreshadowing the English economist John Maynard Keynes, who would famously oppose tying sterling to gold. Law also understood that money drives trade and, if the economy is weak, printing money will kick-start it. This observation is an essential part of modern central banking and it follows that Law is the spiritual father of quantitative easing.

Had Law relied exclusively on a land-backed paper money rather than a speculation-backed paper money, his system might well have succeeded. Years later, in more prudent hands, money issued by the central bank and backed by a government promise would end up underpinning the most successful monetary regime the world has ever seen â€“ the fiat system.

In the years immediately after the collapse of the Mississippi Company scheme, France was bedevilled by monetary crises and deployed an unsustainable tax system, and we know where that led to in 1789. John Law's experiments, at least in part, laid the foundation for the French Revolution. And that's not all. American patriots fifty years later cited the corruption of Charles Spencer and his cronies as one of their many reasons for breaking away from Britain. The proximity of the King and members of the Cabinet to the financial skullduggery of the South Sea Company revealed to the American revolutionaries the rot at the heart of the British system. Perhaps Law, with his alleged accomplice Spencer, encouraged not one but two revolutions.
