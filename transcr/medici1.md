1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,920
To man, the Bank of Medici, and all it entails, to the world, the painting, the miracle of

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:37,439
Saints Cosimo and Damian, by the Master Frangelico. To God, the life my brother Damian never lived,

3
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:45,119
taken by his creator at the moment of our birth. And to the devil,

4
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,439
pain I live with and that will in time inevitably take me too.

5
00:00:55,919 --> 00:01:09,519
The Medici, bankers, gangsters, popes, by Mike Walker, episode one, Cosimo.

6
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,760
If you listen very carefully in Florence, you can hear the sound of gold.

7
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:29,360
How would you like it, Patrizio? Florins or ducats? Or would a note of credit suit

8
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,760
your business better? If you're going international, I would recommend...

9
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:41,040
There was nothing you couldn't buy in Florence, including brides. So this story could begin

10
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,239
once there was a girl who was sold for gold. But then it's not really my story at all,

11
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:52,800
but like most stories in Florence, it does begin in a bank. So my friend, are we agreed on this?

12
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,919
Giovanni di Medici, old Giovanni. People tended not to disagree with him. The terms, my friend,

13
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:04,959
are... More than generous, Marco. The house of body, my family's bank, had gone bankrupt,

14
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,000
spellbound by the promises of an English king who ended up owing us the value of a realm.

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,600
Never lend to kings and princes. Countessina is precious to the family,

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,919
Messer Giovanni. Daughter married to the heir of Medici? What could be better? We're expanding,

17
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:31,679
we'll be bigger than ever. My promises are cast in bronze. And Cosimo? Is he in charge or are you?

18
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:36,880
Tell me. Trust me to do right for you, Marco. We're old friends, we knew each other well, eh?

19
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:44,559
I want Cosimo married. I want grandsons, not bastards. Take my hand and say yes.

20
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:56,559
Yes, of course. A fortunate joining of houses. Countessina will be overjoyed.

21
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:04,720
In life and banking, old Giovanni got what he wanted. And I was it, it seems.

22
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,600
One more credit set against a debit.

23
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:17,759
Medici Bank of Florence. Annual report, 24th of March, 1415. Assets and liabilities.

24
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:31,119
Balance in cash book, 22,269 florins. General ledger G, 62,443 florins. Record books F and G,

25
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:43,600
4,910 florins. Balance in the hidden books, 10,423 florins. Total, 100,047 florins.

26
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:55,679
Do you play, Madonna? No, Signore Cosimo. Do you? No. We stood there looking at each other

27
00:03:55,679 --> 00:04:01,919
for the longest moment. He was one of the ugliest men I'd ever seen, with a strange

28
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:11,919
twist to his body. But quite young, which was something. I apologise, I've not done this before.

29
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,759
Oh, really? I hear you have a mistress.

30
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,839
Oh, I wasn't supposed to say that, was I? I hear that it has become fashionable to educate

31
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,320
girls in the humanities. I'm not sure it's a good idea. Well, you don't want a stupid wife, do you?

32
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,359
I hope to have a dutiful and happy one, at least. Do you?

33
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:42,239
May I ask you something? Contessina, it means little contessa. I know what it means, I am what it means.

34
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:49,359
What do I bring to the richest family in Florence that they do not have?

35
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,200
Beauty, charm... Oh, please, it's not a buffalo, don't milk it for cheese.

36
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,079
You are a very forward young woman. Well, the Di Bardi connection...

37
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,600
Go on, Signore. Well, will bring us a degree of acceptance from the...

38
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:12,559
The first families. My father started out as a money changer in doorways,

39
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:18,000
operating on a board he carried with him. In many ways he still sees himself as that man.

40
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:25,760
He says money has no breeding, but he feels it. I feel it. And what do you say?

41
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,320
I say they do business with us, borrow from us, sometimes even listen to my father. They invite

42
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,920
us into their palazzos, but only into the public rooms, and they pass laws saying we can't wear

43
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:45,920
nobles' boots. Who's they? Rinaldo Abizzi, the Pazzi, the conservatives on the Signoria council

44
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,600
who run the Republic, the gonfalonieri, the leader of the... I know what a gonfalonieri is.

45
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,720
I was educated, remember? You didn't approve, but it may save time. Of course. Excuse me,

46
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,239
Madonna. The gonfalonieri is always one of their nominees. We and our friends are always outvoted.

47
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,279
They treat us like tradesmen. But I speak too openly. It's not much of a wooing. Oh, I've

48
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,399
had manners in breeding. Endless young men who kiss my hand and quote Petrarch,

49
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:22,559
but not one of them has ever spoken to me about things that matter. You think it matters?

50
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:33,119
Tell me one more thing. What do you want? To be King of Florence. Florence as a Republic. For now.

51
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:42,160
I think if you'll have me, Cosimo Medici, I'll have you.

52
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,480
And after the marriage service, a party.

53
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,880
And whatever the old man might think, Medici always gave a good party.

54
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,679
You like to dance? Everyone likes to dance, except painters.

55
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:01,200
What do you know about painters? I know a good one when I see them.

56
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You are an extraordinary young woman. Niccolo, come dance the next with my wife.

57
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,000
I give you love and admiration on this day of days. This is Niccolo Tannucci, my friend,

58
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,640
despite the fact he comes from the wrong side of town. What this oaf means is that like you,

59
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,720
Madonna, I bear an illustrious name and the blood of princes. May we dance?

60
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,239
If my husband has no objection. Today, I insist. Tomorrow, I would have to kill him.

61
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:37,359
He's a brigand, but he will be a great man. We will both be great men. Musicians,

62
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:49,279
play your hearts out for the damned Medici. I hear it's not easy to be a great man in

63
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,480
Florence. It's so crowded with them already. But we don't sit there sipping wine and remembering

64
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:58,959
when we were great. We look to the future when we will be great.

65
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,040
You, sir, come from an old family. As do you, Madonna.

66
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,279
My Cosimo only comes from a rich one. What are you asking me?

67
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,880
What brings you together? We want to be citizens of a new Florence.

68
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:20,160
Look outward rather than in. We want to be navigators on a great ocean who will discover

69
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,160
wonders if only we dare to leave the comfort of the shore.

70
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,279
You're an adventurer and a dancer.

71
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,039
You dance well with Nico. I was taught well. It's an accomplishment.

72
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,479
He's a good man. Do you like him? I think I do.

73
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:47,200
I've known him since we were boys together. Dio, Dio Verdi.

74
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,479
Padrone, madame, may I offer my duty to you on this fortunate day?

75
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,679
Now here is another fellow you may trust with your life and our honor.

76
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,239
Dio Verdi is my strong right arm. You may call upon him any time. He will be there.

77
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:08,880
Madonna, your servant always. Your enemy is my enemy, and you have but to say the word

78
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,039
and he will be no more. Is that how you see Florence,

79
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,320
Signore Verdi? Madonna, it's how Florence sees Florence.

80
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,280
Excuse me. Are there so many enemies?

81
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,080
My father wants to be friends with everybody, which would be wonderful,

82
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,520
only they don't want to be friends with us.

83
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,640
The wedding night was not quite what I'd been led to expect.

84
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,479
Madonna.

85
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:49,520
Signore, I don't know what to do. I mean, I know what to do. My mother told me, but now we...

86
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,320
May I sit?

87
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,719
We are in pain.

88
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:04,960
It comes and goes. Our curse. We all, my grandfather, my father.

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,760
It doesn't help his temper. Or mine, I'm afraid, at times.

90
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,640
Can I do anything?

91
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,159
The doctors do their best. Gout twists the body, shaves the soul.

92
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:32,400
Oh, too much dancing today. I'd pay tonight. No, it goes. It goes. Our hair shirt.

93
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:37,200
Take my hand and ask the Blessed Virgin for help.

94
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,919
It is God's reminder that we are sinful men, that our work, what we do.

95
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:51,440
And the Bible calls it usury, and we try to buy absolution, contessino,

96
00:10:51,440 --> 00:11:00,159
but the very thing that we are buying absolution from, it twists us, as my body is twisted.

97
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,200
Fathers. Our father in heaven and my father on earth.

98
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,080
They look down on us all, our fathers, and we try to do what they want, but

99
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,599
God is merciful.

100
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,400
And old Giovanni is not.

101
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,640
Perhaps mothers are better in the end, more merciful.

102
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,400
The price was paid, the deal was sealed. The sheets were inspected, and I was a Medici.

103
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:36,479
I had joined the great dance of time and affairs.

104
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,280
I had joined the great dance of time and affairs.

105
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,239
There were children and the family.

106
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,359
Signore, you have a son.

107
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:51,359
Thank you, nurse. So, Giovanni, I have a son, Piero di Cosimo.

108
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:55,440
The house has a future now, padrone. We must plan for it.

109
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,359
I pray he's without the family curse.

110
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:58,960
But not without the family ambition.

111
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,039
And there was the world, and to that world, as wife and mother of Medici,

112
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,280
I was to be shown off with Nicotinucci at my side.

113
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,239
That was Leon Battista Alberti.

114
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:17,359
His father ran their bank into the ground. He's gone for learning.

115
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,159
Very wise for one so young, they said.

116
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,679
And the man who looks like he just drank nettle wine with a sting still in it?

117
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,479
Rinaldo Albizzi. They named a street after him.

118
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,880
Landowner, owns the Signoria Council, and chooses the leader,

119
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
which means he sets the taxes for citizens.

120
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,719
No friend of ours, no wife tonight.

121
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:37,039
Signore Albizzi, it's a great honor to receive you.

122
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,919
I'm only sorry your wife could not...

123
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,359
She is sadly indisposed, madam.

124
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:51,440
But may I compliment you on this glittering display?

125
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,599
It is very bright.

126
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,440
And you, Madonna, are the diamond set as its center.

127
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,960
Your husband has chosen well.

128
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,280
It is kind of you to say so.

129
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,239
Young Medici always had an eye for value, if not for tradition.

130
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,159
Signore Albizzi, I had not thought you'd find the time to honor us.

131
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:17,280
I honor your father, Cosimo.

132
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,640
We are both old in the service of our republic.

133
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,159
I hear you are introducing innovations in the counting house?

134
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,159
Fiscal independence to your branches, eh?

135
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,400
Most interesting, if...

136
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,119
Yes, Messer?

137
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:36,719
Risky.

138
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,479
I'm surprised Giovanni gave his permission.

139
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,239
Oh, he did not.

140
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,000
Excuse me, I see an almond cake.

141
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I adore almond cakes.

142
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,719
Cosimo, Giopatti just arrived.

143
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:53,280
You should...

144
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,200
Go and romance him a little.

145
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,359
Is that the young man there?

146
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,440
Old family, still in banking.

147
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,200
A good friend to have a bad enemy.

148
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,679
The elections are coming and we need his support on the council if we are to change things.

149
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,200
We are fine friends, Nico.

150
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,440
I wonder how many of them are true.

151
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,640
In those faraway days, we had all before us.

152
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,599
But the past was always present.

153
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,119
I prayed to our blessed mother to spare our son the family curse,

154
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:25,280
while Cosimo argued with his father.

155
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,760
Old Giovanni still ran the bank from his bedroom, where the gout confined him.

156
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,719
Do you no longer have yourself announced, Cosimo?

157
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:37,760
Or is it that I am no longer of any importance in the family?

158
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,520
We all bow before you, father.

159
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,799
But you don't listen.

160
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,299
You...

161
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,460
Are you?

162
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,520
Am I what?

163
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:46,719
In pain?

164
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,000
In agony?

165
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,039
Why ask questions when you know the answer?

166
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,039
What were you thinking of?

167
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,239
What were you thinking of?

168
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:58,159
This so-called attempt to interfere with elections with us in your ear?

169
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,440
It's common sense, father.

170
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,559
We need to get our people on to us.

171
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,200
On to what?

172
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:04,640
I have spent my life building this bank.

173
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:08,799
Like Joshua, do you plan to throw down its walls with trumpets?

174
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,239
You have built a great bank.

175
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,119
Enough, enough.

176
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:11,619
I...

177
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,659
Oh.

178
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,419
Oh.

179
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,159
Oh, mother of God.

180
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,119
Satan twists my body, Cosimo.

181
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,200
Shall I call your physicians?

182
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,559
Why? Do you think they will help?

183
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Not me, not my father, not you.

184
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,679
This we live with.

185
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:34,239
What I cannot live with is you drawing the attention of the Signoria council to our house.

186
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:37,280
Until we are part of the government of Florence, we will always be vulnerable.

187
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,840
Albizi sets the taxes we pay.

188
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,559
He can break us.

189
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,760
At a cost to himself.

190
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,880
Which he will gladly pay.

191
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,000
We must start taking part in the Signoria not on sufferance, but by right, as first citizens.

192
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,039
Oh, be silent, boy.

193
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:56,159
We have the respect of every good man in this republic, and the ordinary folk, too.

194
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,799
They trust us with their money.

195
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,599
Do not abuse that trust.

196
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:02,640
Do not lose it.

197
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,799
Can you not see...

198
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,299
Listen.

199
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,760
My son, by all that is holy, steer clear of the city council

200
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,679
until you know its members and their wishes as you know yourself.

201
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,239
Wait to be called.

202
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,159
Wait to be called.

203
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:19,539
Wait.

204
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:22,659
Wait.

205
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,880
Call the doctors.

206
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,919
Call the priest.

207
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,419
Call...

208
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,460
Father.

209
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:52,500
My friends, we are here to honor a great citizen.

210
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,140
Giovanni de' Medici.

211
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,539
A man who honored the traditions of Florence.

212
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:04,739
Who knew and valued the old ways of the Republic.

213
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:12,260
The tried ways that have underpinned the foundations of this mighty palazzo

214
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,180
we have built in an ancient and verdant land.

215
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,520
Nico.

216
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,420
Cosimo, my greatest sympathies.

217
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,819
Having to sit through that load of old bollocks from Albizzi.

218
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,099
That was no tribute, Nico.

219
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:35,619
It was more like an election speech.

220
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:36,579
It's what they do.

221
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:39,459
They use everything, even death, for their own advantage.

222
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:43,219
A moment of your time, Cosimo, if I may.

223
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:44,020
Of course.

224
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,020
For Albizzi, I will always have time.

225
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:47,619
Walk with me.

226
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,500
A great responsibility has come to rest upon your shoulders, my friend.

227
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,660
Your father was a considerable man.

228
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,660
Florence will miss his voice.

229
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,819
I thank you for your kind words, Messer.

230
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:08,900
And yet the scenario goes on and Florence goes about its business.

231
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,699
A dissenting voice is always useful.

232
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:18,979
It gives us pause, balance, as long as that voice understands how things are.

233
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:23,859
And doesn't actually have a voice in changing your minds or your policies.

234
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,140
Precedent.

235
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:30,579
Policies that have served the Republic well for 40 years.

236
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:33,219
Policies that are holding us back, if I may say so.

237
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,140
Is that so?

238
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,939
I have ambitions for our Republic.

239
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:39,140
We need to expand.

240
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,140
Florence needs to reach out and...

241
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,260
Where ambition leads, disaster follows.

242
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,540
Do not try to be a leader, Cosimo Medici, before you have learned how to follow.

243
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,780
Your father knew this.

244
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,579
That's why...

245
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:53,859
He died frustrated.

246
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,420
I heard he died arguing with his son.

247
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,459
Oh, Cosimo, don't for a moment think that anything is secret in this town.

248
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,260
Your father knew his place and we respected him for it.

249
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,060
If you do not, we will cut you down.

250
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,939
Give my respects to your mother and your wife.

251
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,819
In those trying days of mourning, the city was full of Albizzi's hounds.

252
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,099
Only in the country, at the family estate in Caffaggiolo,

253
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,579
could we gather up the scattered boughs.

254
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,540
My father planted these lemon trees when he was a young man.

255
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,099
They give us shade and food.

256
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:43,959
Here.

257
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,219
Smells so fresh.

258
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,699
That's what he said.

259
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,180
Shade and food.

260
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,300
But sharp to the taste.

261
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,180
Everywhere I look, I see him.

262
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,420
He was always there, like the mountains, and then...

263
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:07,079
Cosimo?

264
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,939
After the council meeting that was supposed to honour my father,

265
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:16,020
Albizzi looked at me as if I wasn't there.

266
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:17,939
Go on.

267
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:20,900
I might have been a fly, an annoyance that he could brush away.

268
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:22,739
Who bothers about a fly?

269
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,819
I was simply not a matter of concern.

270
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,819
I, um...

271
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,859
Had a brother.

272
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,699
We were twins, but I never knew him.

273
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,420
He died soon after we were born, and...

274
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,819
Sometimes, I...

275
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,060
Somehow, I feel something missing.

276
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,219
A part of me.

277
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:52,359
Damien.

278
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,260
His name was Damien.

279
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,780
We were named after brother saints.

280
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,739
A life that flickered for a moment, and then was gone.

281
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,859
Well, a life that was still alive, and...

282
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,619
Part of the family.

283
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,739
Merdici, all of you, all of us.

284
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,579
We're one thing together.

285
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,459
Love it or hate it, that's what we are.

286
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:18,579
Live or die.

287
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:23,459
I was somebody else once, but now, I am Contessina de Merdici.

288
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,300
You are Cosimo de Merdici.

289
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:27,380
Your brother was...

290
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:30,180
Damien de Merdici.

291
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:34,339
It feeds us and consumes us.

292
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:35,380
It's what there is.

293
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,099
There's no choice, then.

294
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:40,900
Except to be what we are.

295
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,780
Nico Tinucci told me that you wanted to be mariners,

296
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,619
who dare to leave the shore and set out across the unknown ocean.

297
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:51,060
To conquer undiscovered countries.

298
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,859
Whatever the risk.

299
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:56,099
And then, all those who depend upon me,

300
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,660
you, and our children, the bank,

301
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:02,739
our people, everyone we lend money to, support,

302
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,979
the builders, the artists.

303
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,859
What if I fail?

304
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,099
Do you think you will?

305
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,739
Before your wife, the mother of your children,

306
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,979
do you fear of our future?

307
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Because if you do, then it would be better to take that paring knife and finish it now.

308
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,619
He looked at me for the longest time.

309
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,260
Then he took the lemon I'd given him and ate it.

310
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,540
Skin, sharp fruit, and all.

311
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,939
Interim report, September 1430.

312
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:43,060
The policy of operating the Rome branch of the bank without capital,

313
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,660
on deposits from the Vatican and clergy, is showing good results.

314
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,420
Profits have increased markedly.

315
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,459
If you will sit, gentlemen.

316
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,140
Of course.

317
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,739
My friends, for years we have bankrolled this town.

318
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:02,020
Oh, there are other banks, I think.

319
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:06,260
And there's old money, aristocratic money,

320
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,699
fastidious money that doesn't care to get its hands dirty.

321
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:12,660
They leave it to House Medici to get the shite under our nails.

322
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,900
They forbid us even to dress like them.

323
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,739
And they despise us whilst being happy to take their percentage,

324
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:20,739
which grows bigger with every bite.

325
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:23,699
Well, friends, I've had it with being bitten.

326
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:25,380
It's time we bit back.

327
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,979
We're the horses that pull this wagon,

328
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:31,300
and they're the ones holding the reins and the whip.

329
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,020
Not anymore.

330
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:35,219
Here's where we start to get the respect that's long overdue.

331
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:39,219
And I tell you, if they won't give it to us, and they won't,

332
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:41,859
then quite simply at the next meeting at the Signoria,

333
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:43,939
I shall demand that we be heard.

334
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,219
The young man wishes to have a greater voice on the Signoria.

335
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:55,619
Would he like to become the gonfalonieri, perhaps?

336
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,020
Or would he prefer to be the King of Florence?

337
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,699
Does his great experience in civic matters,

338
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:09,219
in foreign policy towards our neighbours,

339
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:16,819
his long experience of very little apart from the Counting House,

340
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:20,979
fit him for this office he wishes to claim?

341
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:23,780
I say no.

342
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,380
Not now.

343
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,140
Not ever.

344
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:30,739
Leave it to the grown-ups, Sonny.

345
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,900
His damned arrogance!

346
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,260
Will be our advantage.

347
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:38,099
I don't understand.

348
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:38,900
Gio, tell him.

349
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:41,459
The Lion is King of this jungle.

350
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,099
He takes no heed of his enemies.

351
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,819
He feels only contempt for them, which blinds him to any threat.

352
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:51,699
And in that darkness we lay our plans.

353
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:52,900
Exactly, Padrone.

354
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:56,739
Who sees a need and waits to be asked for help

355
00:24:56,739 --> 00:24:59,140
is as unkind as if he refused it.

356
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:03,459
So, we help each according to his needs.

357
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:08,339
Messer Silvio, well met, my friend.

358
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,859
Recovered from the drubbing Albizzi gave you yet, young man?

359
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:16,020
Well, a lesson learned is never wasted, Messer.

360
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,660
I also heard from our friend Lippi

361
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,979
that you were looking for a sketch by the master Giotto.

362
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,819
Oh, you heard that, did you?

363
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,180
Perhaps I can help?

364
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,099
Well, if you could, then I could perhaps help you.

365
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,619
What a beautiful melody, eh, Signore Pazzi, my friend?

366
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,619
Makes the soul weep and...

367
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:41,140
Oh, she breaks my heart.

368
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,579
Such skillful fingers.

369
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:47,939
How would you like to meet her later?

370
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,420
I'd be in heaven.

371
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,619
And we can count on your heavenly vote?

372
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,560
Come.

373
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,380
Pietro Valla is here.

374
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,660
Pietro, my friend.

375
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,219
Come in.

376
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:04,020
Thank you, Padrone.

377
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,579
Sit, sit.

378
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,699
Now, how are things with you?

379
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:08,260
They go well.

380
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,420
That little trouble?

381
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,180
Get cleared up, thanks to your...

382
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:14,420
For our friends, always.

383
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,420
My family is in your debt.

384
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:20,819
As it happens, there is a matter on which you can help, Medici.

385
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,660
Anything, you know that, Padrone.

386
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,300
There is a little danger, but we will be behind you

387
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,900
and all your debts will be cleared.

388
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:29,380
Well, I'm ready.

389
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,680
Take this.

390
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,380
Conceal it well.

391
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:37,140
At the formal procession of the Signoria, on the opening...

392
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,060
Let me through!

393
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,739
Stand back there!

394
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:41,939
Find Albizzi.

395
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:42,660
Let me pass!

396
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:45,219
Rinaldo Albizzi!

397
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:47,140
And in full view of the Signoria.

398
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,819
Signior Albizzi!

399
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,000
Get him now!

400
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,739
I call upon Messer Albizzi.

401
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:05,380
This man, a friend of House Medici,

402
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,099
offered violence to a member of the Signoria.

403
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:12,660
His aim was assassination.

404
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,180
I move that he be tried and, if the guilty verdict is agreed,

405
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,140
executed as tradition and the law demands.

406
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,739
The Signoria is sacrosanct.

407
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:27,459
Sacrosanct?

408
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:30,260
Councillor Medici.

409
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:32,739
These charges are rubbish.

410
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:37,060
There is no proof, only rumor, gossip passed on.

411
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:40,660
The man Pietro Valle was not even carrying a dagger.

412
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,540
He was reaching for a loyal petition he intended to present

413
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,459
to the Messer, the noble princely...

414
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:49,219
Is paper a crime now in Florence?

415
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,859
I call for a vote.

416
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,260
Today we gained an advantage.

417
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,459
We've lain down the challenge.

418
00:27:58,099 --> 00:27:59,619
Wine, Signora Tanucci.

419
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:02,099
Valle walks free, Albizzi is frustrated.

420
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:04,260
We disrespected him.

421
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,459
God, he looked sour.

422
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:07,300
And when that happens in one part of a man's life,

423
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,859
it soon begins to spread like rats in the house.

424
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:12,099
Now we see what happens next and...

425
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:14,180
And to prove that he was still the lion,

426
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,219
that his balls were still the biggest in the city,

427
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,060
Albizzi took Florence into a war.

428
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,540
Luca, a state no-one has noticed for years,

429
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:28,579
has used its time to build an army.

430
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,660
They're casting greedy eyes on our republic.

431
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:35,699
They want what we have.

432
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:37,859
We had to move with care.

433
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,020
Cosimo could not be seen as opposing a popular war,

434
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,099
so Nico took the lead in the Signoria.

435
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:48,579
The Honourable Ronaldo Albizzi is right in what he says.

436
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:50,020
They cast covetous eyes,

437
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,979
but wrong, I believe, in what he proposes.

438
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,020
I have proposed nothing yet.

439
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,140
Does Messer Tanucci have witches at his command

440
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,500
to see the future?

441
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,180
The chairman and his followers

442
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,020
will recommend an armed response.

443
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,420
And you? What do you offer?

444
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,180
We talk to Luca.

445
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Oh, you can talk.

446
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,500
You're very good at chatter, Tanucci.

447
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,219
But I say, will Luca listen?

448
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,979
The fools have voted for war.

449
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:22,660
Calm yourself. Sit down.

450
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:24,579
Cool wine for the master.

451
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,420
Surely it was always a possibility.

452
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,979
The second coming is a possibility, little Contessa,

453
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:33,219
but I can guarantee it won't happen tomorrow.

454
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,300
And I can guarantee that with his war,

455
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,900
Albizzi has stamped on our plans.

456
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,380
Our new branches in Geneva, Avignon,

457
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,819
they need time to grow.

458
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:42,819
The wool business, the silk trade,

459
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:45,300
will cease before it's had a chance to establish itself.

460
00:29:45,939 --> 00:29:47,939
The Signoria is back under his spell.

461
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:49,300
And men will die.

462
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,020
We all die.

463
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:51,699
That's inevitable.

464
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:52,819
But let's not get on our knees

465
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:54,099
and invite death into the house.

466
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,540
When the lion is wounded, he roars

467
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,780
and struts and bites anything that's near.



1
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,840
Luca is handy, that's all. Wine, padrone.

2
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,120
The Signoria is infected with valour and glory.

3
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,360
Old men are pulling on rusty armour and forming a war council.

4
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,200
Friends of ours have switched sides.

5
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,080
Which is, of course, what you must do.

6
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,760
Are you running mad, woman?

7
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,719
If we get into a war with Luca, then Naples, Venice,

8
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,480
anyone who fancies a slice of Florence will join with them.

9
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,000
They hate our republic.

10
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,080
They want to bring it down and feast off the corpse.

11
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,240
The way to become great in this city is exactly in times of war,

12
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,279
not on a horse or with a sword. That's not our business.

13
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,639
Our business is...

14
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,480
Banking, yes. Actually, I do know that.

15
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,080
And that is our weapon.

16
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,439
Brava. A toast.

17
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,599
And if we lose this war?

18
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,279
Money never loses.

19
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,040
So Medici never loses.

20
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,360
Well?

21
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
First, we must bite the lemon.

22
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,439
You sure about this, Cosimo?

23
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,840
No.

24
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,160
And we're nothing if we're outside the house with the beggars, Nico.

25
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
We have to be inside.

26
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,720
Gio, anybody moving in there?

27
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,879
Top left window, man with a crossbow.

28
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:08,040
Is it loaded?

29
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,360
Not much use if it isn't, padrone.

30
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,000
Palazzo Albizi.

31
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,040
Cosimo de' Medici desires to speak with His Honour

32
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,519
Principe Rinaldo degli Albizi.

33
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,839
Will they go for it?

34
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,440
Come ahead, Medici.

35
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:24,760
On foot. Alone.

36
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,559
No bloody way you're going in there alone.

37
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:28,639
It has to be, Gio.

38
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,839
But if this goes wrong...

39
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:30,919
Yes?

40
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,199
...you kill them all.

41
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,599
Burn the palace and salt the earth.

42
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,400
Thank you for inviting me into your home, Rinaldo.

43
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,199
I'd rather invite the plague, Cosimo.

44
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,559
I had some respect for your father, that's all.

45
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:50,480
I have an offer for you.

46
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,400
Well, you're a tradesman.

47
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,720
What are you selling today?

48
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,440
A truce.

49
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:59,000
We both care about Florence, about the Republic.

50
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,040
If you will have your war...

51
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,160
I've got it.

52
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:04,480
Can you afford it?

53
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,120
Hmm?

54
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:08,759
What if it isn't over in a week?

55
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,399
Cos it won't be.

56
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:12,559
And what if it escalates?

57
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,160
Cos it will.

58
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,080
Have you heard of taxes?

59
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,080
Yes, there are taxes, and this is a rich city.

60
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,800
But how much can people pay?

61
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:24,639
How much, and for how long, can you and your friends keep paying?

62
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,880
I have every confidence.

63
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Do you?

64
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:30,399
Your first families look very fine on your horses

65
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:32,399
with your banners and trumpets.

66
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:34,639
But don't fool yourselves for one moment.

67
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,440
In the end, it's always the common soldiers that win the day.

68
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,880
And I have the people of Florence.

69
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,839
You know, the ones you never quite manage to see when you're riding by.

70
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:47,000
The ones who grow and harvest your wheat

71
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,479
and slaughter your pigs and smoke their cheeks.

72
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,600
The ones who fight your wars and die in them, too.

73
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,039
Do you know how much a crossbow costs?

74
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,600
What about a field kitchen feeding 5,000 men twice a day for how long?

75
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,199
Have you thought about shoes for those men and their horses?

76
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,320
Or shite from those men and their horses?

77
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,360
How much is it going to cost to remove every day

78
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,880
so our glorious army doesn't drown in it?

79
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,320
All this, House Medici can do for you.

80
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:16,039
We have the contacts, we can raise the finance.

81
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,360
Which you'll loan to the city.

82
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,440
At an exorbitant rate.

83
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,880
A fair rate.

84
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,479
These things are set by precedent.

85
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,160
What do you want?

86
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,880
A seat on the War Council.

87
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,320
For me, for Tinucci, he's one of your sort,

88
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,160
so that should be acceptable.

89
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,600
Yes, I never understood what he saw in you.

90
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:38,919
The future.

91
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,039
Or the past, we can see.

92
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,440
The future is unknown.

93
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,440
I don't like the unknown.

94
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,800
You don't have to like it, or me, Ronaldo.

95
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,479
You just have to use us.

96
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,960
Go on.

97
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,839
Your wealth will be safe.

98
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:56,520
Medici will carry the risk for Florence,

99
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,759
and whatever you may think, I want, above all things,

100
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,039
the Republic to survive and flourish.

101
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:09,360
As wars go, it was a small one, and as wars go, it went.

102
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,720
They advanced, we advanced.

103
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,399
Men died, mostly ordinary men died, and rich men strutted,

104
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,679
and Cosimo talked money.

105
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,559
Projected profit percentage of totals, 1429 to 32.

106
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,119
Hidden books.

107
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,040
Florence, 19.5%.

108
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,079
Rome, 62.8%.

109
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,839
Geneva, 11.1%.

110
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,640
Venice, 13.1%.

111
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,320
London, 0.2%.

112
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,359
We are looking at a potential 2 million-plus in Florence

113
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,320
the Republic will need to raise to keep our forces in the field.

114
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,079
What sort of rate are we talking about?

115
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,880
Short-term at 33% per year, guaranteed by the state.

116
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:55,079
Hmm. I think we can sell that.

117
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,119
The year turned, and more men died.

118
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,519
Alliances were made and broken.

119
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,799
Men were brave, and men were cowards,

120
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,320
and women were widows, and winter turned to summer,

121
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:09,200
and Cosimo was the only one left.

122
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,959
And Cosimo talked power.

123
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,880
When peace comes, the people of Florence will look at the Signoria

124
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:16,880
and see men who took us into war,

125
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:20,359
impoverished the state and preserved their own wealth.

126
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,880
And they will look at Medici, who opposed the war,

127
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:25,440
yet joined the struggle and risked their wealth for the public good.

128
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:27,760
And I ask you, who then will be their friends?

129
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,079
Who then will be asked to rebuild the state?

130
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,480
Who then will rule the council?

131
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,359
And rule Florence?

132
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,559
You said it.

133
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:41,000
You actually said it.

134
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:44,399
And the war stopped, and somebody won and somebody lost,

135
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,600
and men could hear themselves thinking again.

136
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,640
And there was peace, and thousands of soldiers came back to Florence.

137
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,760
And finally, the Signoria began to understand what was happening.

138
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:01,279
And they didn't like it.

139
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,839
Hurry up, Piero. We'll be late, and you'll miss the sunrise.

140
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,200
I wish you a good day, madame, and you, young Piero.

141
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,559
Will you require an escort, madame?

142
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,279
Nothing today. Giovanni, thank you.

143
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,679
We're visiting the stables to look at a horse for Piero.

144
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:21,079
Oh! Oh, God, help us!

145
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,920
Oh, God, help us!

146
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,679
Take the boy. Get him inside.

147
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,440
Piero! Piero!

148
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm with you. Medici! To me! Medici! Awake!

149
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,079
Oh, God, what is it?

150
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,399
It's the doors, the casements. Oh, Lord.

151
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,040
Water. Swab it down.

152
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,519
It's blood. Vinegar.

153
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:37,640
They're painted with blood.

154
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,959
And get rid of those goddamn flies.

155
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,920
Padrone, we need to get the family out of here now.

156
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,040
This is a message from Albizzi.

157
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,640
You should move to the country, take the children, the servants.

158
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,760
I didn't marry a Medici to run away.

159
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,320
I'm no warrior, Contessina. I never pretended to be that.

160
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:58,239
But Gioverdi is.

161
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,720
And you have followers throughout this city.

162
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,679
We can't let the old guard scare us.

163
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,760
If we go, Cosimo, will we ever return?

164
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,600
At least we send the children and the household.

165
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:11,359
Agreed. I'll arrange it today.

166
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,519
Albizzi and his lot are not going to give up easily.

167
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,920
Soon, you won't be able to buy a loaf of bread in this town

168
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,239
without declaring your loyalties.

169
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,040
Then we'd better...

170
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,519
Gio!

171
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Padrone!

172
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,480
Are there soldiers? Do we have enough men here?

173
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,279
Stay. Wait. I'll see.

174
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,160
Would they dare arrest you in daylight?

175
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,239
It's impossible.

176
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,519
And in Florence, the impossible happens every day.

177
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,119
Find the children. Make sure that...

178
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,320
Let them dare to lay hands on my boys.

179
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,279
Cosimo, the Signoria want to talk.

180
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,679
Talk is cheap, Nico.

181
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,920
I was there this morning.

182
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,720
They have summoned you so important decisions can be made.

183
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:48,799
About what?

184
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,239
What else but money.

185
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,679
The city is simply broke.

186
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,440
Albizzi can strut all he wants with his threats and blood on your doors,

187
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:59,320
but he knows, in the end, he has to make a deal with you.

188
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,399
The Signoria understand this.

189
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,160
Medici has the power to finance the Republic's future.

190
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,359
We can't trust them, Nico.

191
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,519
We don't have to, Contessina. Their hands are tied.

192
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,640
They can't pay the army. Damn it, they can't even feed the people.

193
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,959
The markets are empty.

194
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,119
This is our time.

195
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,799
This is what we always wanted. This is our undiscovered country.

196
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,000
I asked the gonfalonieri,

197
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,720
what are we supposed to do about the city markets?

198
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:29,040
The war has left the country devastated.

199
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,799
Produce is not leaving the land. People are hungry.

200
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,359
The delegate is correct.

201
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,280
Food is in short supply.

202
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:42,320
The army, despite its great victory, is unpaid.

203
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,119
Tax revenue is seriously down,

204
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,479
and, well, there is a reason for this, which I will announce.

205
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,880
Silvio, take us up to the hall. I have to speak to the Signoria.

206
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,000
They are waiting for you in Mesa, Medici.

207
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,119
To Noci, do you go with him?

208
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
I do, Silvio, and there's no time to lose.

209
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,799
Come, come.

210
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,599
The reason is one man

211
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,280
who is attempting to raise himself

212
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:10,760
above the rank of an ordinary citizen of this Republic.

213
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,359
A tyrant who seeks to take power unto himself.

214
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,359
One who has impoverished our city whilst enriching himself.

215
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,239
I name him as...

216
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Hurry, my friend, this way.

217
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:25,359
I know the way.

218
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
You have to go this way.

219
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,520
I name this traitor as Cosimo de' Medici.

220
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,599
Seize him!

221
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,080
Hands up!

222
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:38,159
Silvio! Nico! Nico!

223
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:40,919
Cosimo de' Medici, in the name of the Signoria,

224
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,919
I arrest you as traitor to the Republic.

225
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
What?

226
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,679
You will be held under guard until such time

227
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,479
as you may be tried for your crimes.

228
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:50,760
What are you saying, Nico? In the name of our friendship?

229
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,919
Oh, I like you well enough, Cosimo.

230
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Simply business.

231
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,880
Look at me.

232
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,440
Tell me. Tell me.

233
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,919
What?

234
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,840
Our plans, what we wanted for the...

235
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:05,400
We made him a better offer.

236
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:07,799
Surely you can understand that.

237
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,000
You're a moneylender.

238
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,840
Abizi, you don't have to do this.

239
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:14,520
Oh, but I do.

240
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:17,919
The Council commands and I obey.

241
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Lock him up.

242
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And as for Tannucci...

243
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,679
I am truly sorry, little Contessa.

244
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,679
You'll never speak my name again.

245
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,080
You have no right to it.

246
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:31,520
Your family, your possessions, you may keep what is yours.

247
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,840
You'll have to leave the city, of course.

248
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:36,119
Florence has had enough of Medici.

249
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,039
Get out.

250
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:41,400
Well, you will understand in time, perhaps.

251
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:44,000
We looked at each other.

252
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Hate in our voices and in...

253
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,200
in our eyes.

254
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,280
Goodbye, Madonna.

255
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,640
You want me to kill him?

256
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,119
Street fight?

257
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,799
Accidental death of a traitor?

258
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,119
Or poison?

259
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,919
Flower pot falling from a balcony?

260
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,799
I could make it look good.

261
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,479
He's not important for now, Gio.

262
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,679
We have to think about Cosimo.

263
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,799
Don't get up.

264
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,080
So your friend betrayed you.

265
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:27,799
Blood will out, it seems.

266
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,479
They tell me you're not eating.

267
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,880
Scared of poison?

268
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,960
They also tell me you're writing notes.

269
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,039
Promising money, if the guards taste the water

270
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:43,919
before you drink it.

271
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,200
It might be easier if you, uh, didn't.

272
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,200
Easier for your wife and children.

273
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,559
Spare them the pain of a public execution

274
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,599
as a man of honour.

275
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:59,200
But then you were never that.

276
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,640
Just a glorified moneylender.

277
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:05,440
I suppose you'll hang on to life

278
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,679
as long as you have breath in you, like a louse.

279
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,599
And you will die, and we will go on.

280
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,479
What was yours will be ours.

281
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:22,280
House Medici will be no more.

282
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:27,000
That is what I shall take from you, Cosimo,

283
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,400
before I take your life.

284
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:33,799
Your money will ensure the survival of our republic.

285
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,599
Medici won't even be a memory.

286
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,719
I'm finished here.

287
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:45,719
Ronaldo.

288
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:48,880
Everything that has to happen has happened.

289
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,280
And you are already...

290
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,080
And you are a fool. Look out the window.

291
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:02,159
What you see down there, those are my people.

292
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,440
They have the streets.

293
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,520
And who has the streets has the city.

294
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,599
Where's your army?

295
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,520
The Signoria was convened in a special session to try Cosimo.

296
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,520
Guilty.

297
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,719
And Albizzi owned the Signoria.

298
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:23,719
Guilty.

299
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:25,520
Which meant he owned the vote.

300
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,520
Guilty.

301
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:27,520
Before the trial.

302
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,520
Guilty.

303
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:29,520
And after.

304
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,520
Guilty.

305
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,719
But somewhere among the Signoria,

306
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:37,520
conscience or caution lived.

307
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:41,520
They would not pass the death sentence.

308
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,520
If they cut down Medici,

309
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,520
they knew that Albizzi could cut down any of them.

310
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,520
So they waited.

311
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,520
And Albizzi acted.

312
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,520
He hurried to the bank.

313
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,520
To our bank.

314
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:02,520
Stay where you are. Nobody leaves.

315
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,520
Are you the manager?

316
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:07,520
I am, sir, as you know very well.

317
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,440
How may the Medici bank help you?

318
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,440
The Medici bank and its contents

319
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,440
are now the property of the Republic of Florence

320
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,440
by virtue of the fact...

321
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,440
What are you doing here, Signora Contessina?

322
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,440
This is not a suitable place for a woman.

323
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,440
Nor for an enemy of my family.

324
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,440
Say what you have to say.

325
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,440
With pleasure.

326
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,440
Your bank is forfeit.

327
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,359
The property of the Republic of Florence.

328
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,359
More likely of you and your friends, Albizzi.

329
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,359
Manager, I will require a complete accounting of funds,

330
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,359
bonds, outstanding loans,

331
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,359
coin and script of gold and silver bullion

332
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,359
of everything presently.

333
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,359
What?

334
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,359
What is it, man? Speak!

335
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,359
Hidden books, January to September, 1433.

336
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,359
Bank transfers from Florence branch

337
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,280
to the Medici bank of Venice, 25,000 florins.

338
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,280
To Naples branch, 47,000 florins.

339
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:16,280
To the monastery of San Marco, 5,877.

340
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:22,280
Monastery of San Meniato al Monte, 3,000.

341
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:25,280
To the Medici bank of Rome...

342
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,280
That's it, gentlemen. One florin.

343
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,200
All that is left.

344
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,200
Of course, if the Court of the Signoria desires it, you may.

345
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,200
Take it with you.

346
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,200
This is...

347
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,200
When you leave.

348
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,200
This is...

349
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,200
It must be...

350
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,200
When were these transfers drawn down?

351
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,200
Oh, months ago. Three, even six in some cases.

352
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,200
I believe it's all quite legal.

353
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,200
The city...

354
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,200
It's broke.

355
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,200
How can we...

356
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,200
There's no food, no...

357
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,200
If you have no more business here, Signore Albizi, I will thank you to leave.

358
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,200
This is unacceptable.

359
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,200
No. It is very hard to swallow, but it will be good practice.

360
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,200
What are you talking about, woman?

361
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,200
It was to be some time before Albizi understood my words.

362
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,200
It is the will of this council

363
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,200
that Cosimo de' Medici be exiled from the Republic of Florence

364
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,200
for the period of ten years.

365
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,200
He went to Venice, where he was an honoured visitor.

366
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,200
Messer de' Medici, you are twice welcome here in our city.

367
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,200
The Duke was a good and overdrawn customer of the Venice branch of the bank.

368
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,200
And I know, though he wishes it kept quiet, that His Holiness himself...

369
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,200
Pope Eugenius IV,

370
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,200
also a good and needy customer of the Rome branch of the bank.

371
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,200
He looks with sympathy upon your predicament.

372
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,119
Medici is ever at your service.

373
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,119
And once settled,

374
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,119
Cosimo received constant secret news from home.

375
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:12,119
Padrone, the situation here slips from bad to worse.

376
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:16,119
The Signoria cannot find the funds it still so desperately needs.

377
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,119
The children go on well and miss their father, as does the city of Florence.

378
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:23,119
As we expected, Padrone.

379
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:25,119
The armies are still unpaid.

380
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,040
You've been amongst them, and they are angry.

381
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,040
Those are my people.

382
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,040
They have the streets.

383
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,040
And who has the streets has the city.

384
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:40,040
Where's your army?

385
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,040
You leave your families, you risk your lives.

386
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:49,040
Up to your arses in cannonballs and arrows.

387
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,040
You freeze, you burn.

388
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,040
You eat shite twice a day for three years

389
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,959
and get told to say,

390
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,959
''Thank you, my lord.''

391
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,959
The shortage of provisions is felt most in the markets

392
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,959
whilst the people go hungry.

393
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,959
And they are angry.

394
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,959
And while honourable soldiers starve,

395
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,959
Rinaldo Albizzi and his friends count their money

396
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,959
and stuff their faces in their palaces.

397
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,959
They are not your friends.

398
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:25,880
There is only one man with your interest at heart,

399
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:27,880
a man of the people.

400
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:29,880
There is only one. Cosimo!

401
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:32,880
Cosimo! Cosimo! Cosimo!

402
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:36,880
Cosimo! Cosimo! Cosimo! Cosimo!

403
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,880
Stop. You are forbidden to enter.

404
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:44,880
This is... Stop. In the name of the Signoria...

405
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:47,880
I come in the name of Medici!

406
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:50,880
In just one year, Cosimo returned

407
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,800
and bought the Signoria, which meant he bought Florence.

408
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,800
As once Medici bought me.

409
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,800
It was cheap at the price of buyer's market

410
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,800
and he was never vindictive.

411
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,800
He invited the Pazzi to take a full part in civic life.

412
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,800
He could do that,

413
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,800
since now the Signoria, like the Republic,

414
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,800
belonged to Medici.

415
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,800
As for Rinaldo Albizzi...

416
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,719
Thank you for coming.

417
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,719
Do you know my father planted this lemon grove when he was young?

418
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,719
They give us shade and food?

419
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,719
Appropriate for the man who now feeds and shades Florence.

420
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,719
It didn't have to be this way.

421
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,719
Of course it did.

422
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,719
It came out exactly as you intended all along.

423
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,719
I was right to fear the future.

424
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,719
The people... The people you forgot in your pride.

425
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,719
I did not.

426
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,640
What now?

427
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,640
You become Grand Maestro of the Republic?

428
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:56,640
Your time here is over.

429
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:59,640
Take your people, your money, your friends, and go.

430
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:02,640
I would have had you dead.

431
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:05,640
As I would you, if it were profitable.

432
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:09,640
In this case, mercy has the better return for my investment.

433
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:13,640
The Republic is finished, isn't it?

434
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,640
I agree we were fools.

435
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,560
We believed in something beyond ourselves,

436
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,560
for all our pride and arrogance.

437
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,560
What do you believe in, Cosimo?

438
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,560
Medici.

439
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,560
Bookkeeping.

440
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,560
And the future.

441
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,560
Oblige me with one question, if you will.

442
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,560
Yes?

443
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,560
Niccolò Tannucci.

444
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,560
I believed him, that he'd had enough of your ways.

445
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,479
That his blood told, in the end, that he was one of us.

446
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,479
Do you remember after my father died, you said...

447
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,479
Oh, Cosimo,

448
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:01,479
don't for a moment think that anything is secret in this town.

449
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,479
I knew you had spies in my house throughout the city,

450
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,479
so the game between us all was played to the end.

451
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,479
Tannucci was always with us.

452
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,479
Does that answer your question?

453
00:51:14,479 --> 00:51:17,400
I think perhaps you'd best be on your way now.

454
00:51:17,479 --> 00:51:19,400
You won't be harmed.

455
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:23,400
None of you will, but if you ever come back to this city...

456
00:51:25,479 --> 00:51:27,400
Ah, Gout.

457
00:51:27,479 --> 00:51:31,400
As the father, so the son.

458
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:35,400
You carry your own end within you.

459
00:51:35,479 --> 00:51:38,400
I shall think of that.

460
00:51:38,479 --> 00:51:41,400
It will comfort me.

461
00:51:41,479 --> 00:51:43,400
Goodbye.

462
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,319
Albizzi and his followers left soon after.

463
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,319
Then only one thing remained to be done.

464
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,319
Are you all right, padrone? Shall I call...

465
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,319
Is he here?

466
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,319
Yes.

467
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,319
Bring him through.

468
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,319
Threw me the way into the suffering city.

469
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,319
Threw me the way to the eternal pain.

470
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,319
Threw me the way that runs among the lost.

471
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:13,239
I'll be outside.

472
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:15,239
So, to business.

473
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:18,239
The Pope wishes us to advance 5,000 florins

474
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:22,239
to honour the deal you made with him before you came back.

475
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,239
But...

476
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,239
this isn't about business, is it?

477
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,239
No, Nico. It's time to settle things between us.

478
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,239
Cosimo?

479
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:36,239
We had the courage to wait.

480
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,239
To let time pass.

481
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,239
To adapt our plans to circumstance.

482
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:42,160
To use the moment.

483
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:44,160
To risk all. To win all.

484
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,160
And now we have power in our hands.

485
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:50,160
There can't be two kings in a kingdom.

486
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:52,160
Florence is a republic.

487
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:56,160
No.

488
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,160
Of course, you're right.

489
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:02,160
I thought you were a better man, Cosimo.

490
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:05,160
I say it again. There cannot be two kings in a kingdom.

491
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:09,160
Sooner or later, you will want power for yourself.

492
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,079
You must go far away from here.

493
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,079
Take your family, your money with you.

494
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,079
I wish you no harm.

495
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,079
We could have made something fine.

496
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,079
I'm going to remake Florence in the image of Medici.

497
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,079
Your soul is damned.

498
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,079
In time, it will poison the city.

499
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,079
Goodbye.

500
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,079
I'll walk you out, Nico.

501
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,079
I know the way, Gioverdi.

502
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,079
Of course. Here.

503
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:40,000
This is how we do it at house Medici.

504
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:47,000
Done?

505
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:49,000
Done, padrone.

506
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,000
We'll leave him on the steps of the Signoria.

507
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,000
Send a message.

508
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,000
Perhaps, Lorenzo, that was the moment I finally knew your grandfather.

509
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,920
Knew he had the sheer will to do what had to be done.

510
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,920
Even so, there were still enemies out there.

511
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,920
And their children, their grandchildren.

512
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,920
And I thought of what they say here.

513
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,920
Take time for your revenge.

514
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,920
It is never well done in a hurry.

515
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,920
Remember that, my dear, when you come to rule.

516
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,839
Remember the past is never dead

517
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,839
for its consequences live in each one of us.

518
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,839
As for the rest, the bank...

519
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,839
I was right, of course.

520
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,839
Money never loses.

521
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,839
Medici Bank. Profits, 1430 to 1450.

522
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,839

Medici Bank's total profits, 290,791 florins.

It was directed by John Norton

541
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,680
and was a BBC Audio Wales production for Radio 4.
