<h2 id="episode-1">Episode 1 </h2>
<p>The Ishango Bone dates from around 18,000 years BCE. Discovered on the banks of the Congo in 1950, it is a baboon's <strong><abbr title="股骨">femur</abbr></strong> with a series of tiny little cut-out notches. Archaeologists are divided over the artefact's purpose, but it is speculated that each notch indicates an amount owed by someone to somebody else. If the Ishango Bone was indeed a commercial tally stick, its notches also represent the first known example of value, a highly sophisticated concept.</p>
<p>In the standard account of the history of our species, humans roamed, then we settled, then we roamed again before settling down around 5,000 BCE in small communities that would come to be largely organised around money. But the Ishango Bone theory of early commerce suggests that our ancestors may well have been thinking about money far, far earlier. The people who notched the Ishango Bone were hunter-gatherers on the cusp of a new world.</p>
<p>Anthropologists often refer to humans as a pyrophyte species, one that has been shaped by the technology fire. The thread linking the observations in this series is that, in the course of the last five millennia, we have become, and with apologies to linguistic purists because I made this word up myself, we have become a plutophyte species, meaning a species that has adapted to, and been adapted by another technology - money.</p>
<p>In the past, when trying to explain how our ancestors developed, we often focused on a physical technology that aided our progress, the invention of the wheel, the discovery of coal or the arrival of the plough. But what about social technologies that helped us organise in pursuit of common goals by enhancing human cooperation? One of these tools was language, which humans had developed over tens of thousands of years to communicate with each other in a more sophisticated and collaborative fashion.</p>
<p>With the <strong><abbr title="到来">advent</abbr></strong> of agriculture a few thousand years ago, that social cooperation really took off. As humans started to colonise the land, we generated food surpluses that could be taxed by the state. Early civilisations that adopted money acquired a competitive advantage over others, leading to innovations that radically changed the story of modern humanity.</p>
<p>Today, whether we like it or not, our entire world revolves around this strange invented notion that Vladimir Lenin described as the Great Illusion. Money is at the centre of modern culture. People living thousands of miles apart who don't understand each other's language or customs understand money and speak to each other through money.</p>
<p>Money is a force that dictates the flow of people, goods and ideas around the globe. Money defines the relationship between worker and employer, buyer and seller, merchant and producer. But not only that. It defines the bond between the governed and the governor, the state and the citizen.</p>
<p>Money unlocks pleasure, puts a price on desire, art, creativity. It motivates us to strive, to achieve, invent and take risks. Money also brings out humanity's darker side, invoking greed, envy, hatred, violence, often driven by the prospect of vast financial gain. Money is complex because humans are complex.</p>
<p>We all believe in it and therefore it must be real. But is it real? In fact, money is abstract and it's only given value as long as the rest of us, or at least enough of the rest of us, believe in it. Money like faith is a product of the human imagination that we invented to help us negotiate an increasingly complex and interrelated world.</p>
<p>As hunter-gatherers we were locked in a battle with Mother Nature, but once settled, along with money, we came up with writing, geometry, astronomy, numbers, mathematics, philosophy, architecture and political theory – all advances we would associate with something we call civilisation. Money was a foundational technology, often overlooked, that underpinned and animated human flourishing.</p>
<p>In Greek mythology, Prometheus was punished by Zeus for giving humans fire, a technology so powerful that Zeus feared we would overwhelm the gods with it. If fire was the Promethean force of the ancient world, money is the Promethean force of the modern world. The story of money is the story of humanity itself.</p>
<p>In the decades following the death of Jesus Christ, his disciples planted new ideas about morality. But, in 79 CE, the people of Pompeii hadn't really got that memo, the one about meekness, <strong><abbr title="节制">abstinence</abbr></strong> and self-sacrifice. Much like <strong><abbr title="高档的，富裕的">upscale</abbr></strong> Manhattan, which <strong><abbr title="搬家">decamps</abbr></strong> to <strong><abbr title="纽约长岛东端的一片富人区，包含多个高档的海滨小镇，是曼哈顿富人避暑的热门目的地">the Hamptons</abbr></strong> every summer, <strong><abbr title="时髦的，豪华的">swanky</abbr></strong> Romans escaped the sweltering heat of the city by heading to the coast, as today the Bay of Naples, Amalfi and Sorrento were the choice spots for senators, generals, <strong><abbr title="指那些有影响力的人，尤其是在社会、商业或政治领域推动变革和决策的人">movers and shakers</abbr></strong> and <strong><abbr title="“Odd” 在这里的意思是“不常见的”、“偶尔出现的”。它暗示皇帝并不总是出现在这些度假场所，但偶尔也会有皇帝来此休闲。">the odd emperor</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th of August, their world was suddenly ripped asunder as Vesuvius erupted. Coughing and gasping, they watched in horror as the bustling market cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum disappeared entombed in a molten <strong><abbr title="/sɑːˈkɒfəɡəs/（尤指古代有雕饰的）石棺">sarcophagus</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Over time, <strong><abbr title="（草、植物、田地等）嫩绿的；碧绿的；青翠的">verdant</abbr></strong> fields and pastures hid an extraordinary secret. In 1860, as archaeologists were digging around the base of the now dormant volcano, they uncovered a microcosm of economic activity, submerged under this ash duvet. Luxurious villas, exquisite mosaics, bread mills, brothels, baths and theatres.</p>
<p>Pompeii offers us a direct insight into the life of the Romans, revealing an empire that placed money at the centre of daily life. Mosaics in Pompeii's residences exclaim "Lucrum Gaudium" - profit is a delight, and "Salve Lucrum" - hail profit. Dotted all across the town is a recurring image of a winged man carrying a bag of coins. The Pompeians held him in high regard because he was Mercury, the god of commerce. In fact, our word commerce can be translated literally from the Roman phrase "com mercs", with Mercury, and with mercs, the Romans would transform themselves and their empire.</p>
<p>By the time of the Emperor Vespasian in the first century CE, the Roman Empire stretched from Syria to York, Cologne to Tyre. Rome became one of the most monetised empires the world had ever seen, but its rapid expansion needed money, and this is where Vespasian <strong><abbr title="展现了自己的才华或发挥了应有的作用，大显身手">came into his own</abbr></strong>, pursuing the sensible approach of a little bit of tax on a lot of things. It was Vespasian's embrace of the abstraction of money, its fluidity and transferability, that allowed for the creation of one of Rome's greatest innovations. Trying to break free of the tyranny of coins, limited by the availability of gold and silver, the Romans fine-tuned one of money's most powerful characteristics - credit.</p>
<p>From the perspective of today, finance in ancient Rome appears remarkably contemporary. The extensive use of credit made Roman politics and society susceptible to the vagaries of a new and erratic internal enemy - the credit cycle, with its chief protagonist - the speculator.</p>
<p>In 31 CE, the Emperor Tiberius was enjoying semi-retirement in Capri, when his seclusion was shattered by the news of an alleged coup led by a young pretender called Sejanus, backed by a large number of senators and aristocrats. But Tiberius hadn't got to the top without learning a few tricks. Sejanus was killed, and his gang of traitorous senators and patricians was rounded up.</p>
<p>Shaken by the number of senators prepared to betray him, Tiberius moved against them in the place it hurt them most - their pockets. Seeing that senators were <strong><abbr title="比喻性的英语惯用短语，意思是 “深陷其中” 或 “忙得不可开交”">up to their gills</abbr></strong> in debt and land speculation, Tiberius stipulated that they must keep a certain percentage of their total income in their Italian lands, forcing them to sell speculative land in the provinces to raise cash. Land being dumped on the market at such short notice triggered prices to fall, all the while the banks that had recently been making loans started to call them in. The available money supply contracted suddenly as Romans with gold and silver began to hoard.</p>
<p>The Tiberian credit crunch may have been two thousand years ago, but human behaviour when it comes to money hasn't changed much over the centuries. A liquidity crisis quickly morphed into a bankruptcy crisis, as banks in the great commercial cities of Tyre and Alexandria failed. Tiberius realised that he had gone too far and had imperiled the entire Roman web of credit, proving that the forces unleashed by money in a credit cycle are stronger than any politician or any ruler.</p>
<p>What is the solution to too little money? More money and lots of it. The emperor bailed out the banks by injecting 100 million Sesterces into the credit markets. The markets recalibrated. Tiberius thus became the lender of last resort, the ancient world's first central banker. He actually wrote the playbook for Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during the 2008 crash, by introducing <strong><abbr title="量化宽松（QE），指中央银行通过购买债券等资产向市场注入流动性，从而鼓励贷款和支出。">Quantitative Easing</abbr></strong> - Roman style. Tiberius' intervention was a masterclass in what a central bank and treasury could – and should do - in a credit crunch.</p>
<p>In the third century CE, with the emergence of the Sasanian Empire in the east, Rome was faced with a muscular power that could be said to be its equal. With less secure borders and the possibility that the empire might - for the first time in 400 years - be retreating, the tax base began to shrink. As it became harder to enforce taxes abroad, taxes <strong><abbr title="(shoot up) 急剧上升">shot up</abbr></strong> at home. All the while, the emperor, Galenus, paid for his lavish spending by constantly debasing the currency, <strong><abbr title="（不断贬值货币的行为）加剧了人们对罗马帝国摇摇欲坠的感觉">reinforcing the sense of an empire unmoored</abbr></strong>. He managed to cut the silver content in Roman coins to only 4%, compared with 100% under Tiberius.</p>
<p>In desperation, Galenus introduced a new coin to replace the centuries-old Denarius. This new coin was supposed to be worth 2 Denarii, but contained far less silver, and the resulting hyperinflation caused panic.</p>
<p>In 284 CE, conditions of complete institutional breakdown enabled Diocletian, a soldier from Dalmatia, to emerge as emperor. <strong><abbr title="作者将戴克里先与哈里·杜鲁门进行比较，暗指他在面对困难时采取了强硬且有决心的态度。">A kind of Roman Harry Truman</abbr></strong>, he spent 20 years trying to <strong><abbr title="整顿">sort out</abbr></strong> Roman money, ill-advisedly resorting to a variety of <strong><abbr title="（设定）价格上限和利率上限">price caps and interest rate ceilings</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Around the time of Diocletian, references to the deposit banking system that was once the bedrock of Roman money disappeared.</p>
<p>The fall of Rome has attracted immense interest, and there is little agreement about why the Western Roman Empire disintegrated. An exhaustive study of the various explanations found that 210 different causes had been proposed by historians from antiquity to the present, this clearly isn't an argument we're going to settle here.</p>
<p>However, it is worth considering the notion that money and credit sustained the Roman Empire, leading to amazing feats of financial innovation that for hundreds of years greatly enhanced the coherence and <strong><abbr title="（帝国、组织等）影响力、覆盖范围">reach</abbr></strong> of Rome. The destruction of Roman money, and the beginning of the destruction of the Western Empire happened at around the same time.</p>
<p>Just as the expansion of the empire took time, the disintegration happened gradually. But could it have been triggered by hyperinflation and the destruction of the credit system? Did money kill the Roman Empire? We will never know, but of the 210 different reasons cited by historians, the death of Roman money is surely up there.</p>

<h2 id="episode-2">Episode 2 </h2>
<p>In the summer of 1185, a young man stood on the <strong><abbr title="/kiː/ 码头">quay</abbr></strong> where the Black Death would, years later, slip silently into Europe. The Sicilian port of Messina was a hub of international trade. North African merchants hawked Eastern spices and <strong><abbr title="藏红花">saffron</abbr></strong> heading west. The local wheat, bound for Europe to the north, shared the same <abbr title="/kiː/ 码头">quay</abbr> with leathers and <strong><abbr title="/səˈræmɪks/ 陶瓷">ceramics</abbr></strong> on their way south.</p>
<p>As the Arab merchants bargained, our young man, Leonardo of Pisa, was listening intently while they ran rings around the most experienced merchants from Genoa, regarded then as Europe's sharpest. The Arabs could count in their heads. Leonardo could see that while mental <strong><abbr title="/əˈrɪθmətɪk/ 算术">arithmetic</abbr></strong> was beyond the ability of Europe's most studious scholars, the average Arab date-seller could calculate weights, ratios and prices with lightning-quick accuracy. Precision with numbers gave the Arabs the edge. Where did they learn this magic?</p>
<p>The secret <strong><abbr title="/ˈsærəsən/ 撒拉逊人（阿拉伯人的古称）">Saracen</abbr></strong> tool was mathematics. Anchoring this new way of thinking was the concept of zero, which allowed the Arabs to count in large numbers, to conceive of balance sheets with positive and negative numbers, and to use an amazing tool - algebra - derived from the 8th century Arab mathematician Al Khwarizmi. These advantages put the Arabs on a different commercial footing to their European competitors. While European traders relied on the clumsy abacus, the Arabs displayed extraordinary mental agility that allowed them to express an amount of figs or raisins in terms of an amount of corn or <strong><abbr title="肉豆蔻">nutmeg</abbr></strong>. They accepted various coins from places like Alexandria and Cyprus and gave back change in the local Sicilian currency without missing a beat.</p>
<p>Leonardo's father was a Pisan official based in Bejaia, in modern-day Algeria, and this upbringing exposed Leonardo to Arab educators. While his contemporaries in Italy were learning scriptures and Virgil, he was learning an entirely new language and a technology, algebra, and armed with this knowledge, Leonardo of Pisa, better known as Fibonacci, would change the face of European mathematics and set out a new template for sophisticated balance sheet management and bookkeeping. Innovations like these would drive a new era of commercialism, wealth creation and, ultimately, the patronage of the arts that was the basis for the Renaissance. It might not be too far a stretch to say that without Leonardo da Pisa, there might not be any Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
<p>Embraced to revolutionary effect by the Arabs, the concept of zero had been rejected by Christians and the philosophies that Christianity was based on. Zero was the void, and Greek philosophy refuted the void. The West avoided zero for centuries, with enormous negative consequences for science, commerce, accountancy, and a host of other daily activities. But while Europe and Christianity turned their back on zero, the Hindu civilization of India had no such qualms, and it was from them that the conquering Arabs learnt about it.</p>
<p>Zero allows us to go from positive numbers to negative numbers. If your mathematics is based on counting kings, as it was for the Greeks, it's hard to imagine going below zero or through zero into negative numbers. Even today, the concept of negative numbers is difficult for children to wrap their heads around. Ask any primary school teacher, and they will concur that children find it confusing initially. For the Greeks and subsequent Christian thinkers, maths was real, not abstract. You teach a child that one and one is two, holding one apple in one hand and another apple in another hand. Putting them together, you have two. Likewise, for the ancient Christians, two cows were something they could get their heads around, but a negative two cows? That was far more difficult.</p>
<p>There is one place where the concept of zero and less than zero makes complete sense when talking about money. Creditors have money, positive numbers, and debtors owe money, negative numbers. Another attribute of zero is that it can be used as a placeholder. Without zero, how do you represent large numbers like a million, and how do you subtract, add, divide and multiply them? In practical terms, zero propelled the ancient world into the digital age, a world of modern numerals, big numbers, precision and empiricism, with enormous ramifications for money and commerce.</p>
<p>In 1202, the man we know as Fibonacci published Liber Abaci, the Book of Calculations, in which he set out algebraic principles that essentially enabled merchants to make money. Liber Abaci became the go-to book for traders and an essential tool for international commerce. Revelatory as well as revolutionary, it explained how to calculate interest rates, how to circumvent the church's usury laws, apportion profits and assess revenues and costs. It gave merchants a roadmap to express their produce in terms of somebody else's products, in fractions and in a common currency.</p>
<p>One of Fibonacci's most influential insights concerned the relationship between money and time. He <strong>teased out</strong> what economists call the time value of money, the financial equivalent of, it's better to have an egg today than a chicken tomorrow. This idea underpins all borrowing and lending. It's what we call opportunity cost. If I lend to you, you have the money and I can't use it, so there is a cost to me. The money I earn back from you after you pay me back must be adjusted for the opportunity that I have foregone. The way to calculate this is to divide all the money I get back from you by the prevailing interest rate, which is what I would have got had I simply kept the money on deposit.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, giving money a value over time was revolutionary. Fibonacci's clarity brought these ideas to both the merchant class and the banking class, and it led <strong><abbr title="/ɪnˈeksərəblɪ/ 不可阻挡地">inexorably</abbr></strong> to their combination, the merchant banker. God-fearing Florentines initially banned Arabic numerals, but by the end of the 13th century Hindu-Arabic mathematics was so popular that over a thousand pupils in Florence were attending special Reckoning schools. The Harvard MBAs of the 14th century, they were based on the transformative mathematics of Fibonacci, and notable pupils included Niccolò Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
<p>From 1250 to 1300 the population of Florence grew from around 20,000 to 100,000. The transformation of Florence from a small provincial town into the cradle of the Renaissance was forged by a period of intense financial and civic innovation. A model state, a centre of commerce, learning and beauty, Florence was a merchant city, amongst the first of its kind. It is difficult to overstate how different such a city-state was from the prevailing mode of feudal rule by aristocrats, the church and warrior knights. Florence evolved as a sort of bourgeois democracy, run by elected merchants and their financiers.</p>
<p>In 1252 the Florentine merchants decided to innovate financially, pooling their resources to mint their own currency, the 25-carat gold florin. Financially the florins became the symbol of Florentine power, a credible coin backed by the wealth of the Republic, which Europe could trust, and in time this credibility resulted in the florin becoming Europe's reserve currency.</p>
<p>As merchant power expanded, a showdown between god and mammon became increasingly likely. The business schools, while still reserved for the children of the well-off, changed the way people were educated. Education was no longer the preserve of the humanities, with monks leading the way. The numerical world, mediated by money, was inconsistent with the teachings of the church, mediated by scripture. Money was propelling Europe out of darkness and into the Renaissance light.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was another important financial development taking place in Florence – the emergence of banking. Merchant banking evolved as a natural sequence to the putting-out system, the medieval term for lending to farmers to tide them over between sowing and harvesting. It didn't require a great leap of imagination to start lending money directly for investment purposes. Instead of physically transferring coins between banks, a letter of credit was issued – and, hey presto, we have the origin of the cheque and the chequebook. If you trusted the bank to be good for the credit, then these pieces of paper were as good as money.</p>
<p>A first cousin of the letter of credit was the bill of exchange, which became a sort of international tradable currency, allowing the mercantile system to flourish exponentially. The Florentine banks evolved, alongside those in Genoa, Naples, Milan and Venice, into the area of credit creation by moving to what economists now call fractional reserve banking. So named because the banker only needs to keep a fraction of his reserves to cover the possibility that a depositor wants their money back. And in this way, the banker uses the rest of the money on deposit to create loans, and the growth of credit is exponential.</p>
<p>This development in the evolution of money is like moving from the plough to the steam engine. Finance, making money out of thin air, began to shift power in society from the king to the merchant. Not even the devastation of the Black Death in 1348 could dent the extraordinary development of Florence. In the century after the plague, the city basked in the astonishing intellectual, artistic and commercial genius of Cosimo de' Medici, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. Cerebral brilliance was allied with artistic virtuosity and anchored by the economic muscularity of the merchant class, creating an entirely new model for political power.</p>
<p>This alliance would lead to a questioning of everything that had gone before, and would usher in the Renaissance, followed by the Reformation and the Enlightenment. A new map of Europe was emerging, with Italy at the centre, and Florence one of the jewels in the crown. But it didn't happen by accident. The catalyst that drove the merchants forward was money, and in particular, bank-created money. Money was moving commerce from the physical to the abstract. Mere paper, backed by a bank's reputation, was as valuable as the florin in itself, backed by gold. We were moving into a different world.</p>

<h2 id="episode-3">Episode 3 </h2>
<p>In April 1694, things weren't looking great for a hell-raising Scot, John Law. He'd blown his inheritance on gambling and possibly other delights of the night. His disappointed mother had to bail him out, and now he was going to break the news to her that he had just killed a man. Only 23, John Law was doomed, or was he?</p>
<p>Law had killed Edmund Wilson in a duel with a lunge of a sword to the belly. Apparently Law and Wilson loved the same woman, Betty Villiers, who was also the King's lover. But Law sidestepped the hangman in one of the many improbable scrapes of his life. Murderer, gambler, philanderer, art collector, casino impresario, seducer of women, and general all-round good-time Charlie, the father of monetary economics, was far from the dull stereotypical economist. In time, he would revolutionise money itself, and his legacy is scrawled like intellectual graffiti all over present-day central banking.</p>
<p>John Law was the father of what would become known as fiat money, from the Latin to let it be done, which is money issued by central banks that is not tied to gold. Law's system was constrained only by trust, and, as we will see, the man who slipped the noose also wanted to set money free.</p>
<p>Law's defence against the murder charge was that it was a simple crime of passion. But there is another, more titillating possibility, which is that Law was hired as a hitman. Many years later, in 1723, an alternative and scurrilous explanation for Wilson's luxurious lifestyle emerged in a pamphlet suggesting that Wilson had been kept by a male lover, a nobleman who allegedly had become tired of Wilson. In this story, the killing of Edmund was a simple hit, and John Law was the paid assassin. Letters hint that the nobleman in question was a fellow called Charles Spencer, the third Earl of Sunderland, a direct ancestor of Winston Churchill, Princess Diana and Prince William.</p>
<p>Now if this hypothesis is correct, and the evidence is somewhat circumstantial, then the men most directly involved in the killing of Edmund Wilson on Bloomsbury Heath were John Law and Charles Spencer, and 26 years later, at the height of the stock market bubbles, these two possible criminal accomplices would meet again.</p>
<p>Documents show that the government arranged Law's escape from prison in 1694. Having friends in high places can come in handy, especially if you have information that might compromise them. Law spent the next decade travelling through France, Holland and Italy, and he used his mathematical skills, first noticed at school in Scotland, to make a fortune in the casinos of Europe. But getting rich wasn't enough, and while gaming gave him a rich lifestyle, banking and the possibilities of paper money intrigued him.</p>
<p>And despite being a convicted murderer, still technically on the run, the Scotsman sent a plan for a completely new banking system based on paper money to Lord Godolphin, the English Lord High Treasurer. This 1704 proposal is remarkably modern in tone. In early 18th century Europe there was always a squeeze on money because people wanted the reassurance of gold and silver underpinning the value of cash. For Law, this was a failure of imagination. What if he could come up with another base for his new paper money?</p>
<p>Now at this stage his thinking was that that base should be land, the traditional source of all income in pre-industrial societies, which was a stable and reasonably liquid asset. For Law there was an obvious connection between the amount of money available in the economy and the growth rate. This connection represented a major step forward in economic theory. The nub of his thinking was that a supply of new money would generate economic energy and vibrancy, creating an increased demand for money. From Law's idea flows all modern central bank thinking. Even today the Federal Reserve's mandate to manage the money supply and achieve both growth and inflation objectives stems directly from Law's observations.</p>
<p>Godolphin rejected Law's proposal, but Law got his breakthrough in France. The Sun King Louis XIV, who had died in 1715, had almost bankrupted the country. France faced two crises. One was a shortage of silver and gold, and the other one was a very high level of state indebtedness.</p>
<p>To address the first crisis, Law, as Comptroller General of Finances, suggested replacing metallic money in the form of gold and silver with paper money issued by a new bank, the General Bank, which was established in May 1716. Modelled on the Bank of England, the new bank would coax France's richest nobles to buy its shares. Law omitted to tell the world that the two largest shareholders were himself and the Regent. This private bank, operating under royal charter, then issued paper money. And initially this paper money was fully convertible into gold and silver, but later it would only be backed by the state's bona fides, financed by tax revenues to the state.</p>
<p>The General Bank solved France's first problem. As new paper money circulated freely in the economy, this stimulated France's traders, entrepreneurs and business folk. To address the national debt, Law, having observed gamblers in the casino, came up with the idea of a massive debt-for-equity swap. In simple language, this means betting on tomorrow to solve the problems of today. In the early 18th century, tomorrow, or the future, was the new world, which promised untold profits.</p>
<p>What might happen if Law could enlist tens of thousands of French people into the potential of the colonies via the sale of shares in a company? With the money raised by selling the shares, Law's scheme could then pay off the national debt. In August 1717, Law took over the Compagnie d'Occident, the Company of the West, which had been given monopoly trading rights by the King over French Louisiana. French Louisiana, which was not the same as the present state of Louisiana, was almost half the size of the USA today. It was an enormous tract of fertile land ready to be harvested and mined.</p>
<p>With the Company of the West, Law put his debt-for-equity idea into place, offering existing holders of government debt a swap, their French government IOUs, for the new company's shares. Law made the shares available at a deep discount. This meant that the shares would bounce on purchase and the winners would brag about their new riches, persuading more reticent owners of government debt to have a flutter.</p>
<p>Law glued the state onto his ventures by persuading the Regent to turn the General Bank into the Government's Bank, meaning the formerly private bank was nationalised. From this point, all taxes were paid to, and all state spending dispersed from, this bank. In 1718, as the Company of the West continued to expand, the General Bank was renamed the Royal Bank. The Crown and the murderer were now in it together.</p>
<p>The parent company became known as the Mississippi Company, a sufficiently vague name for an entity that covered everything from sugar to slave trading. The sheer magnitude of Law's operation was breathtaking. Law had succeeded in turning the country into a boom-time economy brimming with paper money and speculation.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, Britain introduced a copycat to the Mississippi Company in January 1720 when the South Sea Company proposed to take over most of British government debt. This proposal was accepted by our old friend the Earl of Sunderland, Charles Spencer, the man who allegedly hired Law to kill Edmund Wilson and who now was Britain's first Lord of the Treasury. Exchange Alley in London hosted the world's second stock market boom, the South Sea Bubble, with enormous crowds flocking to purchase shares not only in this South Sea Company but in a whole variety of bubble companies with charters that varied from the series to the bizarre, including a company that produced square cannonballs.</p>
<p>Back in France the market began to wobble. Law was facing an Emperor's New Clothes moment. Various reasons have been cited for triggering the wobble, ranging from a plague in Marseilles to inflation taking off in busy French ports. Whatever the catalyst, buyers panicked and disappeared and their place was taken by desperate sellers. In panic everybody wanted gold, nobody wanted to touch Law's paper promises. In December, not for the first time, Law was forced to flee a country.</p>
<p>After the South Sea Bubble's collapse in England in 1720, Charles Spencer was brought before the House of Commons and charged with using South Sea shares to bribe politicians and members of George I's entourage, including, yet again, the King's mistress. After a stormy debate, Spencer was acquitted. Once again, the lives of Charles Spencer and John Law were mired in money, mistresses, maybe not murder but certainly malfeasance.</p>
<p>Despite the collapse in the Mississippi Company, Law's innovations laid the foundation for the form of money we use today. And this was Law's legacy. Money issued by the central bank on behalf of the state, deriving its strength from the institutional credibility of the state and, indirectly, made whole by the state's tax revenue. Law showed that money could be unchained from gold and silver, foreshadowing the English economist John Maynard Keynes, who would famously oppose tying sterling to gold. Law also understood that money drives trade and, if the economy is weak, printing money will kick-start it. This observation is an essential part of modern central banking and it follows that Law is the spiritual father of quantitative easing.</p>
<p>Had Law relied exclusively on a land-backed paper money rather than a speculation-backed paper money, his system might well have succeeded. Years later, in more prudent hands, money issued by the central bank and backed by a government promise would end up underpinning the most successful monetary regime the world has ever seen – the fiat system.</p>
<p>In the years immediately after the collapse of the Mississippi Company scheme, France was bedevilled by monetary crises and deployed an unsustainable tax system, and we know where that led to in 1789. John Law's experiments, at least in part, laid the foundation for the French Revolution. And that's not all. American patriots fifty years later cited the corruption of Charles Spencer and his cronies as one of their many reasons for breaking away from Britain. The proximity of the King and members of the Cabinet to the financial skullduggery of the South Sea Company revealed to the American revolutionaries the rot at the heart of the British system. Perhaps Law, with his alleged accomplice Spencer, encouraged not one but two revolutions.</p>

<h2 id="episode-4">Episode 4 </h2>
<p>In September 1922, a young journalist crossed the Rhine from the French city of Strasbourg to Kiel, the neighbouring German town. Based in Paris, he was writing for the Toronto Star. In his soon-to-be-famous matter-of-fact style, Ernest Hemingway explained to his readers the reality of a society where money is destroyed.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Strasbourg, he noticed that nobody was selling German marks. On the German side, he changed 10 francs, less than one Canadian dollar, for 670 marks which, and I quote, lasted me and Mrs Hemingway for a day of heavy spending and we still had marks left at the end. The writer tells of witnessing an elderly German gentleman who couldn't afford to buy an apple for only 12 marks.</p>
<p>Hemingway summed up the dilemma of the majority of Germans in 1922 who were dependent on wages or pensions and who had put their savings into government bonds. Their livelihood was being destroyed by hyperinflation. If on the other hand, you could get your hands on foreign currency, even a German could live like a king. Hemingway observed, the miracle of exchange makes a swinish spectacle where the youth of the town of Strasbourg crowd into a German pastry shop to eat themselves sick.</p>
<p>Hemingway was witnessing a society destroying its money and breaking one of the fundamental bonds between the state and its citizens. You save your money and we will protect it. That civic responsibility was forced to be abandoned in the opening years of the Weimar Republic as Germany descended into one of the most destructive episodes of monetary self-harm in history. In the most successful economy in Europe, how was it possible that an elderly gentleman couldn't afford the price of an apple?</p>
<p>In 1914, Imperial Germany decided to pay for the First World War by borrowing from its citizens. Confident in victory, Germany exchanged people's savings for IOUs, which offered generous interest rates. And right up to the end, the German people thought they were winning the war and that they would all be paid back.</p>
<p>After the war, the new Weimar Republic was born saddled with enormous war debts. At Versailles, there was little appetite for forgiveness. Britain and France wanted the new Germany to be punished for the crimes of the old Germany. Meanwhile, America wanted Germany to pay so that it could recoup the loans that it had extended to the other Allies. In 1914, Britain was the world's banker, but the US emerged after the war as the world's undisputed creditor. This global shift in the power of money, from London to New York, would define the world's monetary relations for the next century.</p>
<p>During the general election campaign of 1918, Prime Minister Lloyd George promised to squeeze defeated Germany like a lemon until the pips squeak. It was inconceivable that the German economy, home of pre-war probity, discipline and order, wouldn't recover. But Germany's situation had changed profoundly, politically, socially and monetarily.</p>
<p>In 1920, Germany faced enormous reparation bills. The Versailles Settlement required that Germany transfer 5% of its GDP to foreign powers every single year. So this means, in practical terms, that the country must transfer real goods out of the economy. Empty shelves always put pressure on prices, but when produce is taken out of the economy, there is also a loss of indirect tax, such as VAT. The German state was obliged to pay reparations in gold, and the consequent sale of marks put ongoing downward pressure on the currency. The government, hemmed in on all sides, was too fragile to raise taxes. So instead, Berlin borrowed from its own central bank to pay its own producers for goods that would never be sold in Germany.</p>
<p>As a result, Germany faced a shortage of goods in its shops. And, as the government was subsidising German manufacturers for goods that the French would never pay for, it also suffered from a massive build-up of government debt, which added enormously to the economic jitters. Foreign politics made things even worse, since the liberal Weimar government also committed itself to social reform, expanding spending on health and public housing. The government couldn't renege on its international obligations, nor could it revoke its domestic political promises. To cover these national commitments, it began to print more and more money.</p>
<p>The more the currency jumped around, the more people became nervous. Money flowed in and out of Germany, depending on rumour and counter-rumour. In January 1923, using Germany's unwillingness to pay reparations in kind as an excuse, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. In the Ruhr, German workers went on general strike in response, while some large German companies called for a mass campaign of civil disobedience.</p>
<p>The French reacted. On the 13th of February, a young German woman called Josephine Malakert was gang-raped by French sailors, and throughout the spring, incidences of rape of German women increased. Germany united against the occupation, citing the abuse of its people in the hope that it might pressurise the international community to persuade the French to end the occupation. For the Weimar Republic, financing passive resistance was a price worth paying.</p>
<p>But the cause of this showdown was German hyperinflation and the destruction of money. Millions of hard-working, middle-class, tax-paying, government-trusting Germans saw their savings wiped out. Teachers, civil servants, policemen, doctors, clerks, people who had bought the supposedly cast-iron war bonds were now hung out to dry. In contrast, people who owned physical assets, such as landlords, farmers and industrialists, didn't suffer so much as the value of their property adjusted upwards with inflation. And at the very bottom, hyperinflation didn't change your position very drastically either, because you had no savings to lose in the first place. Plus, the fear of communism meant that workers' wages more or less kept up with inflation. It was those in the middle, the political ballast of society, who suffered most.</p>
<p>After the hyperinflation, people would want somebody to blame. One man was positioning himself and his party to benefit from this social catastrophe. In November 1923, just as hyperinflation peaked, Adolf Hitler led a failed Munich beer-keller Putsch. Although spectacularly ineffective, the public stand against Weimar would allow Hitler to paint himself as the heroic father-figure, an inspired leader who was ready to serve time in prison for his convictions. Hitler, witness to the 1923 chaos, understood the opportunity presented when money dies. It was a lesson he would not forget, teaching him that money is a weapon like no other.</p>
<p>Years later, at the height of the Second World War, Hitler planned for the Luftwaffe to drop millions of fake pounds over Britain. While some honest citizens might go directly to the authorities, he worked on the assumption that most folk would stuff a few notes under the mattress. By bringing this counterfeit money into circulation, inflation would rip through the system. The cascade of new money would drive British prices skyward, triggering panic. Hitler hoped that the previously obedient British would experience a fire-in-the-theatre moment. They'd freak out, and the ensuing chaos would upend their blitz spirit, compromising the war effort.</p>
<p>In August 1943, Salomon Smolianoff, once a fine portrait painter as well as a Weimar Berlin nightclub operator, found himself in the hell of Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Under 93594, Smolianoff had a reputation that preceded him. In a bizarre quirk of fate, one that saved his life, an SS officer called Hans Kruger, who had previously arrested Smolianoff as part of a criminal crackdown in Berlin, was put in charge of Hitler's top-secret mass forgery scheme. Kruger the Nazi knew he needed Smolianoff the Jew, the expert forger.</p>
<p>Smolianoff now found himself the de facto leader of a motley crew of 142 Jewish specialists extracted from concentration camps around the Third Reich. These men had once been civilian printers, dyers, fine artists, engineers, engravers, metal workers, mathematicians and photographers. They became the crack counterfeiting team tasked with breaking the Bank of England.</p>
<p>Smolianoff's life and those of the rest of the team depended on figuring out what material the English were using for their banknotes. After relentless testing and tearing up of real English notes, the counterfeiters twigged that the English were using rags from old clothing that had been pulped. With this knowledge, their operation could begin. Initially, the secret workshop made limited amounts of five-pound notes. These prototypes needed to be tested, and where better to test the forgeries than the Bank of England itself?</p>
<p>A German industrialist presented himself at a Swiss bank in Zurich, claiming he had received some English notes on the black market and asked the bank to vouch for their legitimacy. The Swiss officials went to work with magnifying glasses and high-powered lamps and declared the notes were legitimate. Kruger was elated, as too was his boss Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS.</p>
<p>The counterfeiters' printing presses went into overdrive. The realisation of Hitler's plan to flood Britain with fake banknotes, forgeries so brilliant not even the Bank of England could detect them, was mere months away. The concentration camp forgers printed a total of £134,611,000 which amounted to four out of every ten pounds then in circulation.</p>
<p>The original plan had been for German bombers to drop the notes over Britain, but by late 1943 the war situation had deteriorated for Germany and the Luftwaffe could no longer provide the planes. Undeterred, the SS had other plans. Germany at this stage was running out of hard currency. The Reichmark wasn't accepted for settling trades on the international market. Sterling was another story. As it was the global reserve currency, the SS could use the forged sterling to buy much-needed war materials and, in the process, line their own pockets.</p>
<p>Sachsenhausen's brilliant forgeries infiltrated the global money supply via a network of middlemen who laundered cash for Berlin. The dying months of the Nazi regime led to a black market in passports, visas and new identities, and a thriving market in stolen goods. Reports to the Bank of England that lots of sterling notes were being used by Nazis aroused suspicion. For example, the ransom for the kidnapped Mussolini was paid for in counterfeited sterling.</p>
<p>At the end of the war, the Bank of England oversaw the destruction of these notes, but so worried was the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street about the quality of the forgeries that it retired all its old £5 notes and introduced an entirely new batch. Just think what might have happened had Hitler's money fallen from the heavens in 1943.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="episode-5">Episode 5 </h2>
<p>In December 1992, a tailback of second-hand Toyota Corollas, Ford Escorts and Fiat Mirafioris, the cars of a middle-income country, snaked its way from a supermarket car park in Northern Ireland to the border of the Irish Republic. On the northern side, bemused British soldiers patrolling their watchtowers weren't sure what was going on. The Irish police, the Gardaí, on the southern side, knew fine well what the story was. Some of their colleagues were in the queue.</p>
<p>It was Christmas, booze was cheaper in Northern Ireland than in the Republic of Ireland, Irish people like to drink and December is party time. The queues this year were longer than usual. Traditionally, the booze arbitrage was exploited by people close to the border. But in 1992, thousands more were desperate to spend their Irish punts. We were witnessing a run on a currency triggered by rumours of an imminent devaluation. Spooked, people wanted to spend and buying beer was a way for ordinary people to hedge exchange rate risk. Buy cheap British beer today, with the expense of Irish money, before it too becomes cheap.</p>
<p>There is no more damning vote of no confidence in a currency than your own people rushing for the exit. A currency collapse proceeds in stages. Initially, it's bankers, financiers and speculators who become fidgety. By the time teachers, nurses, police officers and plumbers are trying to stock up on cheap booze, it's all over.</p>
<p>In the Ireland of 1992, we were observing a run on a relatively new type of money, a currency backed by nothing other than the promise of the state. By then, the whole world was using this type of money, which economists call fiat money. The key difference between fiat money and money backed by a commodity, for example gold, is that fiat money is legal tender, made legal by the authority of the state alone.</p>
<p>That year, I witnessed from the inside what happens when people lose faith in a currency. The experience of working in a central bank has guided my thinking on money, monetary policy and monetary economics ever since. Less than two decades after its currency crisis, Ireland, along with much of the Western world, experienced a devastating banking crash. The same gang in the central banks was in charge, and within 16 years, they had managed to preside over two massive monetary crises, suggesting that their grasp of what money is and how it works might not be that solid.</p>
<p>The Irish central bankers were not alone. They were part of a greater club, a global priesthood. Could this entire worldwide clerisy be wrong about money? As a young economist, I didn't quite appreciate that the world was entering a new relationship with money. We were entering the age of the technocrats, modern day high priests. When a central bank is bestowed with the extraordinary ability to create money, the people who run these places wield enormous power. Unlike politicians, the technocrats are not accountable to the electorate. Take for example the European Central Bank. It is entirely independent, yet utterly political. Because money drives the economy, and the economy drives the political cycle, money is, by definition, political.</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong, the era of fiat money has produced the most extraordinary prosperity. In the 1970s, for example, 40% of the world's population lived under the World Bank's poverty line. Today, that figure is 10%. But fiat money is also a great illusion, and, being based on trust, it is a source of fragility as well as a source of strength.</p>
<p>At the centre of the system are the central bankers, who claim to control money. But do they really? When trying to understand money, a key aspect to comprehend is the difference between currency and finance. Today, currency, such as cash in your pocket, amounts to around 10% of all the money out there. Finance, on the other hand, in all its manifestations, for example your mortgage, makes up the rest.</p>
<p>When you go to a bank and you ask for a loan for a car, the bank creates the money out of nothing. It puts it into your account. And this new money didn't exist yesterday. It has been created not by the central banker's currency, but by the commercial bank as finance. This money, or credit, is the lubricant of finance, and it's governed by contracts. Finance is not determined by the central bank. It is an energy that can propel the economy and the society, sometimes off its axis, from boom to bust.</p>
<p>So when talking about the fiat regime, economists have typically contended that the central bank creates the money, prints it and gives it to the commercial banks, which then push the money into the economy. This interpretation places the central bank at the centre of the system, determining how much money is in circulation. It is the story economists learn in university. Let's call it the push story. The amount of money the economy requires is determined by the all-knowing high priests, using complex economic models. When you read about the US Federal Reserve in the media, you are reassured that this institution has its hand on the monetary tiller.</p>
<p>But I'm not sure that that's how the system actually operates. Having seen various crises, where the central bank is not only not in charge, but doesn't appear to have a clue what's going on, I believe money works the opposite way. Let's call this the pull story, where the central bank is not pushing money into the economy, but is actually being pulled by the economy and the economy's appetite for money, which is whetted and served by the commercial banks.</p>
<p>The commercial banks, as in the case of you buying a car a minute ago, create money out of nothing. They are given a licence by the central bank to do so, but the central bank doesn't control them. What it does is it sets targets, it sets standards, but it doesn't actually control them. And ultimately the central bank is pulled by the economy's appetite for money, rather than pushing the money into the system.</p>
<p>And this is why central bankers sit around trying to set the rate of interest, because the rate of interest is the price of money. But the central bankers can only, like any monopolist in any area of economics, they can either set the price or the quantity, but not both. So the price of money is set by the central bankers, but the quantity of money is set by the commercial bankers who act independently.</p>
<p>The central bankers are therefore guessing what direction the economy and the money supply might take, and the financial markets are speculating on that guesswork, and the media is speculating on the financial markets, so everybody is speculating on the guesswork of others. Which isn't exactly reassuring, is it? Can the central bankers control finance and its role in the economy? Not really, and this is why, when things go wrong, it is the central bankers who are left carrying the can and looking stupid because they didn't control the game in the first place.</p>
<p>So when you ask yourself, why do we have recurring banking and financial crisis? This is the answer. The people in charge are not in charge. And behind all the central banking pomp and ceremony, there are mortal humans dealing with that most incendiary of substances, money.</p>
<p>How is money likely to evolve from here? Well, like language, money has always been a living thing, and like the adoption of a new word, each monetary innovation has made money more useful. So while social media and Wall Street were going on about crypto, a far more compelling form of money was emerging, organically, in an unlikely region.</p>
<p>In much of Africa, a major impediment to development is a lack of credit and banking. Many, particularly rural Africans, rarely see a bank in their day-to-day lives, but they do have mobile phones. In 2007, the same year Bitcoin arrived, a more ingenious currency called M-Pesa was being introduced, with little fanfare or investment. M-Pesa, M is for mobile and Pesa is Swahili for money, turns mobile phone credit into money. It is a bottom-up adaptation that responded to a real demand and solved a real problem.</p>
<p>On street corners in Kenya, you'll see hawkers selling pay-as-you-go mobile phone airtime. They are agents of an incipient monetary and social transformation. Using basic text messaging technology, M-Pesa allows Kenyans to deposit money on their phones, buy and sell using the debit and credit function on their phones, transfer money on their phones, and borrow and save through phone credit. Safaricom, the country's leading mobile phone provider, undertook to cash mobile phone minutes for the local currency. This move allowed mobile phone minutes to become currency, with commercial banks facilitating the exchange.</p>
<p>In rural Kenya, small loans are extended to tide farmers over from harvest to harvest, not unlike the putting-out system described in the early medieval period. The money loaned is phone credit, whose value is understood by everyone. Once poorer people accessed this basic banking tool, phone-based money took off. Before M-Pesa, the way to send money home to the Kenyan countryside was to give cash to a bus driver who would charge up to 30% of its value to deliver to a remote village, and often the money simply disappeared. With M-Pesa, the money is transferred via phone credit, and the phone credit is then used to buy supplies in the local shop. No bus driver, no risk.</p>
<p>Right now, there are 50,000 registered agents acting as tiny banks all over Kenya, and 70% of the population use M-Pesa, while 30% of the country's GDP is generated via M-Pesa. This is real monetary innovation.</p>
<p>Today our advanced civilisation has electric cars, smartphones, nuclear weapons, vaccines, contraceptive pills, artificial intelligence, takeaway Tandooris and global supply chains, plus 8 billion of us manage to live on this crowded planet. Such feats of organisation, productivity, innovation and collective brain power are not enabled by ideology or religion or force, but by money. Money acts as the central nervous system of that highly complicated, always adapting organism we call the global economy. It is the defining technology of humanity.</p>
<p>M-Pesa is the embodiment of money's evolution, spontaneously adapting and thriving in response to its environment. Who would have predicted that mobile phones would become banks and phone credit would become money? The evolution of money, like the evolution of humanity, constantly surprises.</p>
