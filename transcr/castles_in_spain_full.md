*Narrator:*

*“Castles in Spain”, a serial in five parts by Edward Boyd, with Ray Brooks as Mayer. Episode 1.*

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> The last time I’d been there, the accountant’s office had had a comforting air of permanence. It had Dickensian resonances, Victorian vibrations, Bob Cratchit, Scrooge, even Mr Tolkienhorn from Bleak House. And once there’d been an old man behind a heavy oak desk, who would have recognised these names, and who had had great respect for books and everything and everyone who had to do with them, including me, Mayer, the bookseller.
>
> But that was yesterday, or the day before, or the day before the day before.
>
> The old man had retired to comfortable Surrey, and his high-tech grandson had blitzed the office electronically. Box files had become computers, columns of figures mere fodder for calculators, and word processors with memory banks had replaced the old amnesiac typewriters. And yet, beneath all the glitz and technological gloss, there creaked an ancient bone.

*[In the bookshop]*

Rainsford: I’m afraid, Mr Mayer, your stepfather’s decision is final.
Mayer: Well, that would appear to be that.
Rainsford: Perhaps if you wrote to him personally.
Mayer: I don’t think I could do that, Mr Rainsford.
Rainsford: Speaking as a businessman, I…
Mayer: Please, Doctor.
Mayer: I suppose this development has been on the cards since my mother died.
Rainsford: Are you saying that your stepfather disliked you?
Mayer: I think that would probably be doing him an injustice.
Rainsford: In what way?
Mayer: I think it was summed up a long time ago in an old Scottish proverb: Many a man kisses the bairn for love of the nurse.
Rainsford: And if the nurse drops out of the equation, the kissing has to stop.
Mayer: Which is exactly what has happened.
Rainsford: I know you find it distasteful, but I…
Mayer: Go on.
Rainsford: May we talk business for a moment?
Mayer: If you must.
Rainsford: Quite frankly, Mr Mayer, I find your attitude incomprehensible.
Mayer: In what way?
Rainsford: I don’t think you realise what this means to you financially.
Mayer: You underestimate me.
Rainsford: Well, I’ve fed all the relevant data into the computer.
Mayer: And?
Rainsford: I’m afraid the prognosis is not good.
Mayer: Let’s hear it anyway.
Rainsford: I believe that without your stepfather’s financial support, you’ll be out of business within the next six months.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I left him to his office with its mechanical uncertainties and its doom watch scenarios, and walked out into the blousy urban London autumn. I made my way to a little church I know, not far from my doomed bookshop, and sat there unproductively for most of the afternoon. The place smelt of a kind of cool peace and beeswax, but not of miracles, which was what I really needed. So in the end, I went back to the bookshop, in case the miracle had gone to the wrong address, which it hadn’t.
> 
> She came into the shop, and had it not been closing time, I might easily have granted her the prize for the brightest thing the shop had seen that dank autumnal day. Not the most difficult award in the world to win on that day and in that shop. Not many of her age group ever come into my bookshop, and when they do, it’s usually for all the wrong reasons. Which may be my sour, middle-aged way of saying that all teenagers are, as the lady said of Lord Byron, mad, bad, and dangerous to know.
> 
> Stare in silence long enough at anyone, and you will flood their minds with remembered sins. It has never worked with me, because, and I say this with a certain regret, my sins have all been utterly banal, not worthy of remembrance. Sins of omission.

*[In the bookshop]*

Teresa: Your Mayer?
Mayer: Mr Mayer.
Teresa: You worried about your sexuality or something?
Mayer: My problem is much less complicated. I simply want to close the shop.
Teresa: And you don’t reckon me a member of the great book-buying public?
Mayer: Frankly, I don’t.
Teresa: Should have worn my other jeans, the ones with the 6A-level patches.
Mayer: I’m sure I’d find them fascinating, but some other time.
Teresa: Hang about. Hang a bloody bout.
Mayer: Another five minutes, and I’m going home.
Teresa: Don’t bet on it.
Mayer: I never bet.
Teresa: Watch it. Your halo’s showing.
Mayer: And your five minutes is ticking away.
Teresa: Jarama.
Mayer: Yes?
Teresa: That ring any bells for you?
Mayer: Somewhere in Spain, isn’t it?
Teresa: Let’s not play silly bloody games.
Mayer: All right. What does he want this time?
Teresa: He wants to see you.
Mayer: Why?
Teresa: I’ve got wheels outside. Suppose I take you to see the man?

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I shut up shop and followed her outside. The wheel she mentioned had a chassis and an engine, had a price tag that weighed in at around £15,000, and bodywork that had not seen water since the last brisk shower of rain. And somehow, don’t ask me why, I found this reassuring.

*[In the car]*

Teresa: Do you want to drive?
Mayer: I don’t.
Teresa: I’ll bet you don’t drink or smoke either.
Mayer: You’re absolutely right.
Teresa: I’d say that all adds up to a pretty negative sort of person.
Mayer: Depends on how you define negative.
Teresa: I define it in terms of things I hate.
Mayer: All right, then. I hate cars, alcohol and tobacco. But most of all, I hate amateur psychiatrists. Now, let’s just go wherever we’re going.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Seated beside her in the car, I was suddenly more aware than I should have been of the autumn city. The lowering buildings, people, the deathbed extravagance of the trees in the parks, the urban generosity of the sky, all sere and yellow. Mirror image of myself, or perhaps more accurately, of what I’d allowed myself to become.

*[In the car]*

Teresa: Have you known him long?
Mayer: You mean the man you’re taking me to see?
Teresa: Who else?
Mayer: I hardly know him at all.
Teresa: Yeah?
Mayer: Never met him outside the shop.
Teresa: Uh-huh.
Mayer: You’re making a mysterious mountain out of a mundane molehill.
Teresa: I know my grandfather.
Mayer: Which is more than I do.
Teresa: He’s a very devious person.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> A traffic light halted us, and as we sat there patiently, its red light hung on the encroaching dark like a birthmark. Her hands on the wheel looked brown and capable. Her fingers wore no rings. Then the light changed, but the subject of conversation remained the same.

*[In the car]*

Teresa: I wonder what he wants.
Mayer: Mankind would have been immortal if Eve hadn’t been so nosy.
Teresa: So who wants to live forever?
Mayer: Your grandfather’s a very devious person, you said. What else is he?
Teresa: He’s a sick man.
Mayer: Physically or mentally?
Teresa: I’ll leave you to make up your own mind about that.
Mayer: That’s an answer.
Teresa: The best you’ll get from me.
Mayer: Ever get the feeling you’ve been here before?
Teresa: What do you want about now?
Mayer: This is the second time you’ve driven up this street.
Teresa: Very observant.
Mayer: Now I know another thing about you. Was that the object of the exercise?
Teresa: Of course.
Mayer: I don’t quite understand why.
Teresa: My grandfather has a great respect for my judgment of people.
Mayer: Are you old enough to have any?
Teresa: I’m old enough not to rise to that kind of bait.
Mayer: That sounds as though you’d already made up your mind about me.
Teresa: I have.
Mayer: Am I allowed to hear the verdict?
Teresa: No.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> The darkness was moving in. And car headlights began to make their appearance like mechanical fireflies. And the colour died out of a hundred shop windows as lights were switched off. And people came surging out of office buildings. And then, in no time at all it seemed, we were in a different London. A part where those people lived who had found the legendary streets that were paved with gold. And who had grabbed it all. And kept it. And who had grabbed it all. And kept it.

*[In Teresa’s house]*

Mayer: Is this where you live?
Teresa: You don’t approve?
Mayer: It’s hardly what I expected.
Teresa: What did you expect?
Mayer: A social conscience could get very lonely around here.
Teresa: A social conscience is probably lonely anywhere.
Mayer: I wouldn’t know about that.
Teresa: My grandfather thinks you would.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> She walked quickly away. So quickly I had to hurry to catch up with her. And we climbed the expensive steps towards the expensive door whose surface had never been sullied by a tradesman’s knuckles. And it opened quietly with a kind of wooden obedience. And if it had bowed, a polite, obsequious bow, you would not have been surprised.
> 
> He stood just inside the door. An immaculate old man who wore his age like a well-cut suit. He had hair like white silk and disturbing blue eyes that stopped being disturbing once you realised that he was blind. When he spoke, you recognised the accent they only sell in Oxford or maybe Cambridge.

*[In the house]*

Coleman: It was very good of you to come along, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Um, not at all.
Coleman: I hope you didn’t find Teresa too uncouth.
Mayer: She’s very, um, forthright.
Coleman: She is totally devoid of good manners, a rude little bitch.
Mayer: Look, I’m sure you wouldn’t wish to embarrass me, Mr, um…
Coleman: Coleman. Jocelyn Coleman.
Mayer: She didn’t even have the common courtesy to introduce us.
Coleman: Let me make this quite clear, Mr Coleman.
Mayer: I didn’t come here to discuss the social graces or lack of them of someone I hardly know.
Coleman: Then why are you here?
Teresa: My grandfather asked him to come.
Coleman: Really, Teresa? Did you have to disappear and leave Mr Mayer like this?
Teresa: I disappeared, as you put it, for two reasons. Grandfather asked me to let him know at once when Mr Mayer arrived.
Coleman: I don’t think we need to go into the second reason.
Teresa: Why not? The second reason…
Coleman: The second reason, Mr Mayer, is that for some strange reason, Teresa can’t bear to be in the same room as me.
Teresa: Grandfather will see you now, Mr Mayer.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I followed her out of the hallway and into what seemed almost like a picture gallery. There were paintings everywhere, and I registered in my interested amateur way one that might have been a Christopher Wood, a couple that declared themselves unmistakably the work of that Cornish curmudgeon, Alfred Wallace. And I reflected that while money might not grow on trees, it could flourish quite happily on gallery walls.

*[In the house]*

Teresa: Sorry about that back there.
Mayer: Ever read Tolstoy?
Teresa: No.
Mayer: He says that all happy families are alike, but an unhappy family is unhappy after its own fashion.
Teresa: They should have that up in lights in Piccadilly.
Mayer: Does Coleman know why I’m here?
Teresa: No.
Mayer: That makes two of us.
Teresa: He thinks you’re a private detective.
Mayer: Who in God’s name told him that?
Teresa: I did.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> It was my day for surprises, and it still had some way to go.
> 
> Teresa tapped on a door at the end of the gallery. A voice bade us enter, which we did, and were transported back half a century. The room might have been a set for a war play, but a play about a specific war and a specific place at a specific time. A long plain table spilled with maps and posters flared from the walls. One of them stated defiantly: *Defensa Madrid es defensa Catalunya. Catalunya.*
> 
> He was sprawled in a deep leather armchair. He looked up at me and smiled. Even sprawling, he still contrived to look military. By my reckoning, he must have been over 70, but he seemed a great deal younger. Perhaps the room with its maps and posters, a bygone war, had become a magic time capsule that kept time in abeyance.

*[In Forrest’s room]*

Forrest: You look flustered, Mayer.
Mayer: I have an identity crisis.
Forrest: What’s your problem?
Mayer: When I walked into this house, I was simple Mayer, the bookseller. Now it seems I’m Philip Marlowe, private eye.
Forrest: Do you know what this is all about, Teresa?
Teresa: I told Jocelyn that Mr Mayer was a private detective.
Forrest: Ha! Ah, you’ll be the death of me, Teresa. You must excuse us, Mayer. A private joke.
Teresa: Now, if you’ll excuse me, you have things to discuss.
Forrest: Nothing that need drive you away, though.
Teresa: Do you mind an audience, Mr Mayer?
Mayer: Well, not really.
Teresa: That means you do. So I’ll leave the pair of you to it.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> She had a quality of swiftness, as though with her, thought and action meshed together in perfect congruence. And after she’d gone, Forrest unfolded himself from his chair and walked across the room to look at one of the gaudy posters on the wall.

*[In Forrest’s room]*

Forrest: You bring back a lot of memories, Mayer.
Mayer: Pleasant ones, I hope.
Forrest: Sun and olive trees.
Mayer: Suffering and death.
Forrest: That too, of course. You know, you do look remarkably like your grandfather.
Mayer: So I’ve been told.
Forrest: I helped bury him, you know.
Mayer: Yes.
Forrest: Yes, all that was a long time ago, in another country.
Mayer: Besides, the wench is dead.
Forrest: What wench are you talking about?
Mayer: My grandmother.
Forrest: I’m not sure I understand what you mean.
Mayer: My grandfather died at Harama, right?
Forrest: I saw it happen.
Mayer: Another one of the birds of the air, aren’t you?
Forrest: I’m not with you.
Mayer: My childhood was sprinkled with their memories. All the strange men who kept turning up at the house from time to time. Some were tall, some were short, some were fat. Not many of them. Some were skinny. They came from all over the country. Manchester, Plymouth, Nottingham, Glasgow, Dundee, Edinburgh.
Forrest: Given time, I could name every one of them.
Mayer: I dare say you could. All ex-members of the International Brigade. Every last one of them.
Forrest: Am I wrong in feeling you resented them?
Mayer: I have the impression that the whole family did.
Forrest: Why was that, do you think?
Mayer: I think they all began to feel eventually that they were living in some kind of bloody shrine. I remember my grandmother saying that her home had become a cenotaph. And she was right. The house was a cenotaph. With one bloody name on it.
Forrest: I notice you don’t mention your parents much.
Mayer: They split up.
Forrest: Hooray for them.
Mayer: Wherever they are.
Forrest: So you were really brought up by your grandmother?
Mayer: Women who marry heroes get used to bringing up kids on their own.
Forrest: Ah, you have the gift of empathy.
Mayer: Oh?
Forrest: Did I say something wrong?
Mayer: Well, you could be suggesting in a roundabout way that I have no personality of my own.
Forrest: That remains to be seen.
Mayer: Am I being tested for something, Mr Forrest?
Forrest: Perhaps.
Mayer: Then why don’t you come right out with it?
Forrest: Tell me, Mayer. What would you be doing if you weren’t here?
Mayer: Nothing very much, I suppose.
Forrest: No wife? No girlfriend?
Mayer: No.
Forrest: No film you must see? Nothing on television you can’t afford to miss?
Mayer: Nothing.
Forrest: No date in the pub with the boys?
Mayer: Nothing like that.
Forrest: Just sitting at home remembering an old lady?
Mayer: That’s rather gratuitous, Mr Forrest.
Forrest: I expected you to say that.
Mayer: My grandmother…
Forrest: A very strong, forceful character, I should imagine.
Mayer: She had to be.
Forrest: Yes, there were hundreds, maybe even thousands like her in the hungry 1930s.
Mayer: I only knew her.
Forrest: And that’s maybe why you’re in danger of identifying with her too closely.
Mayer: What about your granddaughter?
Forrest: Does she identify with you?
Mayer: You’ll have to ask her that yourself. At the risk of appearing rude, Mr Forrest…
Forrest: You must let me do this my own way, Mayer.
Mayer: Very well.
Forrest: I have a letter I want you to read.
Mayer: I’d like you to look first at the signature.
Forrest: Ernest Hemingway?
Mayer: Read it.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I cannot admit to ever having been a great Hemingway fan. For me, whatever he was saying was always drowned out by the sound of muscles being flexed. In this respect, I tended to agree with Max Eastman, whose review of a Hemingway work said, come out from behind the hair on your chest, Ernest, and let’s see who you are.
> 
> In the letter, Hemingway wrote about meeting a chunky little Scot. The little man had his right arm in an aeroplane splint and his left arm hung useless at his side. Yet he strutted along as though he owned whatever earth he trod. There was about him an air of cheerful danger.
> 
> The little man had his right arm in an aeroplane splint, and his left arm hung useless at his side. Yet he strutted along as though he owned whatever earth he trod. There was about him an air of cheerful danger.

*[In the scene that the letter mentions]*

Hemingway: Salute, comrade.
Cameron: Salute.
Hemingway: Looks like you’ve been busy, soldier.
Cameron: Aye, you could say that.
Hemingway: Can I ask where?
Cameron: You some kind of reporter?
Hemingway: Eh, I guess you might call me that.
Cameron: You looking for a story, whatever your name is?
Hemingway: Hemingway.
Cameron: Well, how’s this for a story, Hemingway? See this splint of mine?
Hemingway: It looks kind of homemade, I’d say.
Cameron: Aye, well, maybe that’s because it is homemade. You’ll never guess where it came from.
Hemingway: Comrade, I’m not even going to try.
Cameron: Well, I’ll tell you then. Four or five days ago, with a wee bit set to in our sector, and I wound up with a ween of bullets in one arm, some fancy bayonet damage in the other. When the dust settled, the medical officer said my arm needed a splint. Trouble with splints was just another thing we didn’t have.
Hemingway: Aye, you seem to have solved that problem.
Cameron: That big Willie McKelvie solved it. “You need a splint, Jock?”, he says, “I’ll get you a splint”, and off he went. Twenty minutes later, he comes back with a big dod of wood, and he’s whittling away at it with his bayonet. “There’s your splint JOCK.” said he. “Where did you get it from?” “Do you know what a sanctuary was?” “It’s a kind of wayside shrine, isn’t it?” “That’s right.” With a bit of cross in it. A big wooden job.
Hemingway: Which your friend thought could be put to a better use.
Cameron: Aye, he did that. He hooked a big chunk out of it.
Hemingway: You’ve probably got the only splint in Spain that’s been blessed by an archbishop.
Cameron: Aye, Big Willie’d like that. He’s a lapsed Catholic.
Hemingway: I have a feeling Jesus might like it too.
Cameron: Well, it’ll be nice talking to you. Better go up to the hospital and have my wounds dressed. Maybe see you around.
Hemingway: Soldier, if I bump into the Pope and he’s looking for a piece of wood, who do I say has it?
Cameron: Cameron. Jock Cameron.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Forrest was staring at me across the room, and across half a century. And for a moment his face gleamed with a kind of lost innocence. And the familiar quotation, when he uttered it, had a sudden new poignancy that I’d not previously recognised.

*[In Forrest’s room]*

Forrest: Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven. That always sounds to me like an epitaph.
Mayer: At least we had one.
Forrest: Will your generation be able to say the same?
Mayer: Probably not.
Forrest: I want you to find Jock Cameron.
Mayer: Are you serious?
Forrest: Deadly serious.
Mayer: There are professionals who specialise in that kind of thing. And what makes you think I haven’t tried them?
Forrest: Anyway, aren’t you too a professional, Mayer?
Mayer: With books, yes. I can search out rare books, find out-of-print titles, things like that. Finding people is something quite different.
Forrest: I don’t think so. Let me tell you something about professionals, Mayer.
Mayer: I’m listening.
Forrest: Professionals live by accepting limitations. Either their own personal limitations or the limitations of the situation they face.
Mayer: I’m prepared to accept that.
Forrest: A good professional will operate to the fullest possible extent, but not beyond that.
Mayer: Are we talking about money now?
Forrest: Money, time, effort, you name it.
Mayer: Where do I appear in all this?
Forrest: Do you remember a book called Bread and Olives?
Mayer: I remember it well.
Forrest: You went to extraordinary trouble to track it down for me, didn’t you?
Mayer: I can get pretty obsessive about books. But not about people.
Forrest: It’s time you started having opinions of your own, Mayer.
Mayer: I find that rather patronising.
Forrest: Such was not my intention, I assure you.
Mayer: Am I supposed to read your mind, sir?
Forrest: There is nothing to be gained by falling out with me, Mayer.
Mayer: Then perhaps you should explain why you think I have no opinions of my own.
Forrest: I was thinking of your grandmother.
Mayer: Why do you keep coming back to her?
Forrest: Because I think it’s time you got her out of your system.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I remember sitting at her bedside towards the end of her life, listening as she put her life into words, her music without bar lines. She talked as though the past, the present, and what was left of the future had all merged into one vast unity. Seamless. The junctions where they met invisible. And to her, irrelevant. Sometimes she would get cross with me for not remembering immediately something that had happened long before I was born.

*[In Forrest’s room]*

Forrest: You haven’t heard a word I said, have you?
Mayer: Sorry.
Forrest: I was talking about the different ways that bereavement affects individuals.
Mayer: Yes.
Forrest: Have you ever given the subject much thought?
Mayer: Not really.
Forrest: You’re probably aware that the bereft sometimes suffer from feelings of guilt.
Mayer: That which I should have done, I did not do.
Forrest: Exactly.
Mayer: Where is this taking us?
Forrest: Back to your childhood, perhaps.
Mayer: I’d rather go somewhere I haven’t already been.
Forrest: I’m afraid that’s not on.
Mayer: We were talking about bereavement.
Forrest: We still are.
Mayer: Can we leave my childhood out of it?
Forrest: Is remembering it so painful?
Mayer: No. Just irrelevant.
Forrest: Well, Mayer, I’ve told you what I want. Find Jock Cameron. Is it yes or no?
Mayer: I’d like a little more time to consider it.
Forrest: You have till tomorrow morning.
Mayer: I’ll call you tomorrow lunchtime.
Forrest: Very well.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> He slipped back into his Spanish war time capsule, and I left him there and walked through the gallery with its expensive pictures, their prices multiplying silently and smugly on the walls. Then out of the gallery and into the hallway, where the blind man stood as though he’d not moved since I’d last seen him.

*[In the house]*

Coleman: Is that you, Mayer?
Mayer: Yes, Mr Cameron.
Coleman: Have you come to any arrangement?
Mayer: Well, not exactly.
Coleman: May I ask why not?
Mayer: Perhaps I have reservations about the whole thing.
Coleman: I am delighted to hear you say that.
Mayer: Why?
Coleman: Jock Cameron was a man of violence, and wherever he was, death was not far away. I think, Mayer, that it would be better for everyone concerned if Cameron were never found.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I came out of the quiet, prosperous house into the quiet, prosperous street and walked quickly away, not feeling prosperous, not feeling quiet, but in some undefined way disturbed, and yes, resentful. Two old men and a teenage girl had, in their various ways, called into question everything I had not realised I was.
> 
> Not being very well up in car recognition or the subtleties of A, B, C registrations and stuff like that, I took no notice of the car that pulled in just ahead of me until I saw the driver.

*[Outside the house]*

Teresa: You walk very fast.
Mayer: I always do when I’m afraid.
Teresa: What are you afraid of?
Mayer: It might be against the law to be seen actually walking in this neighbourhood.
Teresa: Jump in before the lynching party arrives. How did you get on with Grandfather?
Mayer: You were right when you said he was devious.
Teresa: So what else is new?
Mayer: Yes.
Teresa: Did you agree to do what he asked?
Mayer: I told him I would tell him my answer, yes or no, tomorrow.
Teresa: You’ll say yes, of course.
Mayer: Why, of course?
Teresa: Because I recommended you as the right man for the job.
Mayer: I’m sorry?

## Episode 2

*Narrator:*

*“Castles in Spain”, a serial in five parts by Edward Boyd, with Ray Brooks as Grahame Mayer.*

*Grahame Mayer is visited one day in his London bookshop by a girl called Teresa, who takes him to see her grandfather, Sandy Forrest. Forrest was once an officer with the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War. Now, fifty years later, he wants Mayer to track down, not a rare book, but a missing person, an old comrade from Spain called Jock Cameron.*

*But as Mayer leaves Forrest’s house to think about this unusual request, he’s met in the hall by an elderly blind man.*

Colman: Is that you, Mayer?
Mayer: Yes, Mr Colman.
Colman: Have you come to any arrangement?
Mayer: Well, not exactly.
Colman: May I ask why not?
Mayer: Perhaps I have reservations about the whole thing.
Colman: I am delighted to hear you say that.
Mayer: Why?
Colman: Jock Cameron was a man of violence, and wherever he was, death was not far away. I think, Mayer, that it would be better for everyone concerned if Cameron were never found.

*[Outside the house]*

Teresa: You walk very fast.
Mayer: I always do when I’m afraid.
Teresa: What are you afraid of?
Mayer: I’m afraid of the law to be seen actually walking in this neighbourhood.
Teresa: Jump in before the lynching party arrives. Where to?
Mayer: Back to the shop.
Teresa: You live there as well? Or are you a workaholic?
Mayer: I’m not a workaholic. I do live above the shop.
Teresa: Sounds very old-fashioned to me.
Mayer: It’s a crown property.
Teresa: What does that mean?
Mayer: When I get a burst pipe or block drain or something like that, I put a call through to Buck House and they send somebody along.
Teresa: A prince of the blood, of course.
Mayer: If there’s one available.
Teresa: Cool. Very cool.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> The evening had settled in, wrapping the city in leisure like a duvet. Musicians were coalescing into orchestras, while in half a hundred dressing rooms, actors and actresses smeared reality with grease paint. Cars slid past, bearing passengers, transformed for the night into penguins or perfumed peons. Critics rattled epigrams in their pockets like loose change, hoping that the magic of a clever phrase would change banality into something handed down from Mount Sinai. A new playwright wondered if she was about to become the genius of the week.
> 
> 
> It was the hour of the theatre.

*[In the car]*

Teresa: How did you get on with Grandfather?
Mayer: You were right when you said he was devious.
Teresa: So what else is new?
Mayer: Yes.
Teresa: Did you agree to do what he asked?
Mayer: I told him I would tell him my answer, yes or no, tomorrow.
Teresa: You’ll say yes, of course.
Mayer: Why of course?
Teresa: Because I recommended you as the right man for the job.
Mayer: What made you do that?
Teresa: Intuition.
Mayer: How very old-fashioned of you. What a devious crowd you are.
Teresa: Not all of us.
Mayer: Yes, all of you. Every last one of you.
Teresa: Sorry?
Mayer: Your grandfather spent his time trying to destroy the credibility of my grandmother.
Teresa: Successfully?
Mayer: What the hell does that matter?
Teresa: Don’t be cross.
Mayer: I have every right to be cross. Your grandfather wants me to do something. Fine. But he wraps up that simple fact in all kinds of pseudo-psychological claptrap.
Teresa: I told him you were more intelligent than you looked.
Mayer: Oh, great. That makes everything all right, then.
Teresa: I could have said you were a load of rubbish. Would you have preferred that?
Mayer: My preference doesn’t appear to matter.
Teresa: Oh, dear. Your vanity’s been hurt.
Mayer: Wrong. My intelligence has been insulted.
Teresa: You can’t even get your act together, you lot. You reckon?
Mayer: Why don’t you take a vote on it?
Teresa: A vote on what?
Mayer: Do you want Jock Cameron found, or would he be better off left wherever he is?
Teresa: We want him found, of course.
Mayer: Coleman doesn’t.
Teresa: How do you know that?
Mayer: He told me. Ironical, isn’t it?
Teresa: What is?
Mayer: Your grandfather wasting all the sweetness and light on me.
Teresa: Was it wasted?
Mayer: I’m afraid it was.
Teresa: So I’ve got to go back and report failure?
Mayer: Not failure. Success.
Teresa: You like playing bloody silly games, don’t you?
Mayer: No, no. I neither like playing them or having them played on me, which is why I intend to find Jock Cameron.
Teresa: What exactly does that mean?
Mayer: It means that I’m not impressed by your grandfather’s reasons for wanting to find Cameron, but I’m fascinated by the possibility of discovering why Coleman doesn’t want him found.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> We finished the journey in silence, but it was not a hostile silence. I felt that momentarily I had ceased to exist, but that what I had said to her still buzzed in her brain, the words unwelcome as picnic insects.
> 
> 
> She dropped me off at the shop and acknowledged my thanks with the bright, automatic smile that a well-brought-up lady confers on someone who has just opened a door for her. And I found myself wondering if in some unknown way I had done just that.
> 
> I collected a bundle of books about the Spanish Civil War and took them up to bed with me. I thought and thought about Cameron. I fell asleep, still thinking of him.
> 
> Then the dream came. And in the dream, a tough little man strutted through a landscape of harsh brown bitterness. He had no face, yet somehow he was whistling.
> 

*[In the dream]*

Mayer: Cameron? Jock Cameron?
Cameron: Who goes there?
Mayer: Friend.
Cameron: Advance, friend, and be recognized.
Mayer: I do not recognize you, friend.
Cameron: Then do not claim the name.
Mayer: You claimed it first.
Cameron: Would you know my skin on a bush in Palestine?
Mayer: Yes.
Cameron: That is a privilege dearly bought.
Mayer: The price was paid.
Cameron: Where?
Mayer: Arama.
Cameron: Was the final payment made there?
Mayer: Permission to speak?
Cameron: Granted.
Mayer: I’ve changed my mind.
Cameron: You cannot do that.
Mayer: Who says so?
Cameron: King’s regulations.
Mayer: I’m a Republican.
Cameron: You are welcome to this land, Republican. This land whose sun has burned green from the spectrum. This land of tasteless bread and bitter oranges.
Mayer: Cameron?
Cameron: Here we have everything a bad humanity requires.
Mayer: Cameron! I want to talk to you!

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I awoke from my dream’s confusion to sunlight and the kind of morning that summer had been aiming at for months and had finally achieved too late. I lay for a while savoring the rest of the autumn to come. Shock-headed chrysanthemums, the acrid smell of burning leaves, old men in the park, bonfires.
> 
> 
> And at that moment I heard the telephone ring.
> 

*[In the bookshop]*

Arnold: I do hope I’ve got the right number.
Mayer: I’m sure we can work something out between us.
Arnold: Let me explain.
Mayer: Put me out of my misery first.
Arnold: Yes?
Mayer: Who should I be?
Arnold: It would be very reassuring if you were a Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Be reassured.
Arnold: I do believe it’s working. Six out of six is good, isn’t it?
Mayer: Anything better would be suspicious.
Arnold: I’ll be round in about ten minutes, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Hello? Hello?

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> He was as good as his word and ten minutes later he walked into the shop. A tall young man whose excessive good looks were cancelled out by the vulnerability. His dazzling smile had paid for some dentist’s holiday in sunny Tenerife. His voice was standard RP and every now and then you felt it belonged elsewhere and to someone else.
> 

*[In the bookshop]*

Arnold: I said ten minutes, Mr Mayer. And here I am, bang on time.
Mayer: Punctuality is the politeness of princes.
Arnold: Couldn’t agree more.
Mayer: You have a nice line in telephone calls.
Arnold: Thank you.
Mayer: Six out of six what?
Arnold: Oh, that, it’s too embarrassing.
Mayer: It’ll go no further than this room.
Arnold: Well, you see, Mr Mayer, I can’t remember lines.
Mayer: Maybe you should stick to mime.
Arnold: It’s not funny, Mr Mayer, I can tell you.
Mayer: What has this got to do with telephone calls?
Arnold: Memory training.
Mayer: Memory training?
Arnold: Right.
Mayer: I’m sure there’s a connection there somewhere if I could only make it.
Arnold: It works like this.
At one time if anyone gave me their telephone number I used to write it down.
Arnold: I used to write it down.
Now I make an effort to remember it.
Mayer: And you find that improves your memory?
Arnold: Six out of six.
Mayer: You haven’t told me your name.
Arnold: Arnold. Hathaway Arnold.
Mayer: Oh, splendid name for an actor.
Arnold: You really think so?
Mayer: Yes, fine Shakespearean ring to it.
Arnold: That’s why I chose it. My real name is Murgatroyd.
Mayer: Well, now that’s out of the way, what brings you here?
Arnold: I’ve come to take over.
Mayer: Would you mind saying that again?
Arnold: I’ve come to take over.
Mayer: Are you talking about this bookshop?
Arnold: Yes. Teresa don’t usually make that kind of mistake.
Mayer: Ah, Teresa. How would you like to indulge in some more memory training?
Arnold: What do you want me to do?
Mayer: I want you to call Teresa and pass on this simple, brutal message. Tell her I’m fed up with her and our whole family, past and present. And that goes for any future members of the family still to come.
Arnold: Suppose she wants to know why?
Mayer: She won’t.
Arnold: I don’t think I can do this, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Nonsense. You’re an actor, aren’t you?
Arnold: Yes.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I went round the corner to a little cafe that was an interesting survival in that the proprietor stubbornly believed that fast food was no food at all but merely a noun contradicted by an adjective. He had weird ideas about music, too, believing, as he did, that the best accompaniment to meals was silence.
> 
> 
> I sat there for about an hour and read one of the heavy newspapers that told me what the intellectual yuppies were wearing, thinking, peddling that particular day.
> 
> Thus refreshed, physically and mentally, I returned to the shop and Hathaway Arnold, whose real name was Murgatroyd.
> 

*[In the bookshop]*

Arnold: You have to meet her at the airport.
Mayer: There has to be more than that, Arnold.
Arnold: Honestly, Mr Mayer…
Mayer: You passed on my message, word for word? And she made no comment?
Arnold: None. All she said was that you were booked on a four o’clock flight and that she’d meet you at the airport. Well, I thought you would know that.
Mayer: Why?
Arnold: I don’t know. Just took it for granted, I suppose.
Mayer: Is it me, Arnold? Tell me, is it me?
Arnold: Is what you, Mr Mayer?
Mayer: Am I walking around with an aura that everybody can see clearly except myself? A big, blazing, multicoloured aura that proclaims to the world, sucker?
Arnold: Can I answer that in my own way?
Mayer: Please do.
Arnold: She’s sending a car to take you to the airport.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Not far from the checking-in desk, she was standing, remote and cool, and for what the word is worth nowadays, virginal. She looked at me as though I reminded her of someone she’d once met at a rather boring party.
> 

*[In the airport]*

Teresa: Better check in.
Mayer: Would it be too much to ask you where I’m going?
Teresa: You’re going to Glasgow.
Mayer: Why? According to the PR men, Glasgow is miles better.
Teresa: Better than what?
Mayer: You know what Robert Louis Stevenson said?
Teresa: I’ll give him two minutes.
Mayer: He said the wise man travels only in imagination.
Teresa: So?
Mayer: I have the feeling of being forced to travel in someone else’s.
Teresa: You’re a fantasy merchant.
Mayer: Maybe it takes one to know one.
Teresa: Look, are you going or are you not?
Mayer: Then get going.
Teresa: I’ve brought you a briefcase.
Mayer: In it, you’ll find everything you need.
Teresa: Have a nice day.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> And with that pious wish, she vanished into thin air or more accurately into the thick, artificial, controlled airport air that smelt of everywhere and nowhere, of tourists and terrorists and have a good day.
> 
> 
> I checked in, and my obedience was rewarded by a boarding pass that entitled me to a free diagnosis by a machine that certified me as free of guns and bombs and other hidden hatreds. And thus driven, I boarded a plane that waited pale and patient like a beached whale anxious to escape the predators of earth even if that meant taking to the air.
> 
> About six miles above the earth, I opened the briefcase Teresa had given me. It contained various sheets of paper, one of which appeared to be a list of addresses. Another said that a reservation had been made for me at a Glasgow hotel. There were four or five tattered postcards and there was money, always a handy thing to have even at 36,000 feet.
> 
> I put everything back in the briefcase and the little man in the seat beside me gave me an approving smile.
> 

*[In the plane]*

Millhouse: It does my heart good to see that.
Mayer: I beg your pardon?
Millhouse: I once flew from New York with a man who kept working a pocket calculator all the way.
Mayer: You should have complained to the pilot.
Millhouse: I got drunk instead. And objectionable, I hope.
Mayer: Not my style, I’m afraid.
Millhouse: Are you a professional, ma’am?
Mayer: I run a bookshop.
Millhouse: Oh, very interesting. New or secondhand books?
Mayer: Both.
Millhouse: I had a great aunt once who wrote a book.
Mayer: Really?

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> The man was a man in a soporific way and eventually he sent himself off to sleep. And the aircraft roared towards the north with its comatose passengers, peas in a 600 miles an hour pod. And the pilot told us it was raining in Glasgow but we decided to land there anyway and we did.
> 
> 
> A taxi took me to the hotel which seemed to have as many flags as a small wall. From my room on the seventh floor there was a view of the river and the ceaseless rain neither particularly interesting. So I took the papers out of the briefcase and gave them a second look at the list of names and addresses at the five tattered postcards which had been posted from various parts of the country which were all in the same handwriting and which were all signed Jock.
> 
> So I decided to phone the top number of the list in the briefcase.
> 

*[In the hotel room]
[On the phone]*

Receptionist: Valleyfield Residential Home?
Mayer: My name is Mayer. I wonder if you can help me.
Receptionist: What seems to be the problem Mr Mayer?
Mayer: I’d like to come and have a word with one of your residents.
Receptionist: Which resident have you in mind?
Mayer: Mr Henderson.
Receptionist: Yes, we do have a Mr Henderson here. Are you a relative?
Mayer: A friend of a friend.
Receptionist: The normal visiting hours are between 7 and 8.
Mayer: I’ll come along then.
Receptionist: Very well. I need hardly remind you of our regulations concerning tobacco and alcohol.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Valleyfield Residential Home was an anorexic building three stories high with a patch of lawn in front that was no bigger than a boy’s size billiard table if not as smooth. The ground floor rooms two of them fronting onto the street were chauvinistic with tartan curtains and there was a strong smell of cats and disinfectant with neither odour predominating.
> 
> 
> At 7 o’clock a bell rang and we were turned loose and a surly nurse with varicose veins conducted me to a small room where a man called Henderson lay in bed. He was about 80 with the complexion of a sound polished apple. He had hair as soft as silk and his eyes were astonishingly blue.
> 

*[In the Valleyfield Residential Home]*

Nurse: Well, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Can we talk in private?
Henderson: Right, Bertha. You heard what the man said. Two’s company, three’s an epidemic.
Nurse: Oh, Mr Henderson.
Mayer: She didn’t seem to want to go.
Henderson: A nosy bugger. Now, what was it you couldn’t discuss in front of witnesses?
Mayer: Nothing.
Henderson: Oh? That won’t take long.
Mayer: I’ve, um, I’ve brought you a present.
Henderson: Tell me something first.
Mayer: Yes?
Henderson: Do I know you?
Mayer: You probably knew my grandfather.
Henderson: Who was he?
Mayer: Augustus Mayer.
Henderson: Oh, it rings a bell.
Mayer: Harama. February, 1937.
Henderson: Killed there, was he?
Mayer: Yes.
Henderson: Something was said about a present.
Mayer: Something was indeed.
Henderson: Is it whisky or fags?
Mayer: What would you say to whisky and fags?
Henderson: Oh, I’d say that was version and overkill.
Mayer: Well, let’s just say it’s in memory of an old comrade.
Henderson: Aye. It sees one of the plastic cups.
Mayer: Right.
Henderson: That’s a drop of the real stuff.
Mayer: Do you mind me asking you a few questions?
Henderson: No. Fire away.
Mayer: First of all, let me tell you who I am and what I’m doing here.
Henderson: Oh, you’ve already told me who you are. You’re Big Gus Mayer’s grandson and that’s good enough for me. As for the other thing, what you’re doing here, for you, you’ll be like the others.
Mayer: What others?
Henderson: Is there a wee taste of that whisky?
Mayer: Yes.
Henderson: Well, there’s these two kids that come to see me every Sunday morning.
Mayer: Yeah. Cheers.
Henderson: Cheers. Aye, there’s two of them. A boy and a girl. And the way things are nowadays, the boy’s the one with the long hair.
Mayer: What do they talk about?
Henderson: They’re never short of subjects, I can tell you that.
Mayer: Worthwhile subjects?
Henderson: Oh, it depends what you think is worthwhile.
Mayer: All done men like me.
Henderson: You think that’s how they see you?
Mayer: No.
Henderson: They’re not doing me a favour that boots on the other foot.
Mayer: In what way?
Henderson: I think I represent something that they feel they’ve lost.
Mayer: Do they ever say anything like that?
Henderson: No. Maybe they’ve lost the words for it as well as the thing itself.
Mayer: Do you remember a man called Jock Cameron in Spain?
Henderson: Well, I’ll be damned.
Mayer: What’s the matter?
Henderson: I was just talking about him the other day.
Mayer: Who was asking you about him?
Henderson: These two kids I was telling you about who come here on Sundays. They decided to turn the Spanish Civil War into a project.
Mayer: Not very original.
Henderson: Why do you say that?
Mayer: Hitler and Mussolini had the same idea.
Henderson: Oh, so they did.
Mayer: Maybe the kids will be lucky.
Henderson: Oh, man. I could have went on all day about him and they would have asked for me. You’d have thought I was talking about some big pop star and not a wee hard man from Coatbridge.
Mayer: Did you keep in touch after Spain?
Henderson: No.
Mayer: Was there a reason for that?
Henderson: Maybe it was because we thought we had failed.
Mayer: You don’t believe that, do you?
Henderson: If I believed that, Mayer, then your grandfather died in vain. If I believed that, Mayer, I could never swear to you on the stack of Bibles that in the same circumstances I would do it all again.
Mayer: I envy you.
Henderson: I don’t care a bugger whether you do or not because that wasn’t my reason for doing what I did.
Mayer: Mr Henderson.
Henderson: Thank you very much for your wisky. Good night to you, Mayer.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Walking away from the Valleyfield Residential Home, I decided that Mr Henderson did not get my vote as Geriatric of the Year. And that seemed fair enough since I suspected that I didn’t rate too highly on his list of people he could not do without. And brooding on this took me through the damp streets all the way back to the hotel.
> 
> 
> I let myself into my room only to fetch up short inside the door and stare astonished at the stranger who stared back at me from beside the window with a kind of defiant embarrassment.
> 

*[In the hotel room]*

Norah: Er, look, I know this must seem very unusual.
Mayer: I’m glad we agree about that.
Norah: This matter seemed so very urgent.
Mayer: First things first. Who are you?
Norah: My name is Norah McGill.
Mayer: How did you manage to get in here?
Norah: One of the maids let me in.
Mayer: Charming. How much did it cost you?
Norah: Nothing.
Mayer: Oh, come on now.
Norah: I told her you were my boyfriend.
Mayer: All the world loves a lover.
Norah: What happens now?
Mayer: I think I’ll call the police.
Norah: Oh!
Mayer: What’s so funny?
Norah: I am the police. Aren’t you going to ask to see my warrant card?
Mayer: When I get my breath back.
Norah: Have a look at it anyway.
Mayer: Seems all right. I suppose these things can be forged.
Norah: Well, you know about forgeries.
Mayer: Less than nothing.
Norah: Have you a passport?
Mayer: Yes.
Norah: Would you mind showing it to me?
Mayer: It’s at home.
Norah: And where is home?
Mayer: London.
Norah: Quite sure it’s not Dublin?
Mayer: Positive. I’ve never even been there.
Norah: Our information tells a different story.
Mayer: Then your information is nonsense.
Norah: What are you doing up here?
Mayer: At the moment I’m trying to keep my temper.
Norah: You are not being very cooperative, Hanrahan.
Mayer: There could be a very simple reason for that.
Norah: Could indeed.
Mayer: I’m no expert in these things, but don’t you lot usually hunt in pairs?
Norah: My partner stepped outside for a minute.
Mayer: Get a fresh pair of thumbscrews, no doubt.
Norah: No doubt.
Mayer: Why didn’t you just call room service? Better open up then, shall we?
Norah: This is Inspector McNeil, special branch.
Mayer: Glad you could drop in, Inspector. Perhaps you’ll explain to me why you did.
McNeil: A slight misunderstanding, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Not much of an explanation, but at least you got my name right.
McNeil: Part of the misunderstanding, sir.
Mayer: Why did your partner call me Hanrahan?
McNeil: Maybe because she doesn’t know what Hanrahan looks like.
Mayer: Do you?
McNeil: That’s the problem, Mr Mayer. Nobody knows what Hanrahan looks like. Are you a patriot, Mr Mayer?
Mayer: Not a very loud one.
McNeil: You disappoint me.
Mayer: Why? What are you expecting?
McNeil: Something more bookish, perhaps.
Norah: Somthing like “Patriotism is a last refuge of a scoundrel”.
McNeil: My partner has an honours degree in English.
Mayer: I’m suitably impressed.
Norah: You still haven’t answered the question.
Mayer: Oh, but I have. It may not be the answer you wanted, but it’s still an answer.
McNeil: Bit flippant, wasn’t it?
Mayer: And you’d rather I was bookish?
McNeil: Well, you are a bookseller, aren’t you?
Mayer: Have you checked that out?
McNeil: Of course. Just now.
Mayer: I think it was G.K. Chesterton who best stated my own particular attitude, my kind of patriotism, if you like. He said, “My country, right or wrong, is like saying my mother drunk or sober.” Is that sufficiently bookish for you?
Norah: Up to a point.
Mayer: Well, if there’s no further business, will you both get the hell out of here and let me have my room back?
McNeil: There’s just one more thing, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Let’s hear it, then.
McNeil: Remember, nobody knows what this Hanrahan looks like. Nobody knows what name he’s travelling under. So keep your door locked. And don’t let anyone in you don’t know.

## Episode 3

*Narrator:*

*“Castles in Spain”, a serial in five parts by Edward Boyd, with Ray Brooks as Graham Mayer.*

*Graham Mayer has been hired by Sandy Forrest, a wealthy elderly gentleman who once fought in the Spanish Civil War, to track down an old comrade who’s disappeared. Mayer has severe misgivings, but prompted by Forrest’s granddaughter Teresa, and armed with a list of addresses, he’s flown north to Glasgow to begin the search for Jock Cameron.*

*Drawing a blank with the first name on his list, Mayer returns to his hotel room, only to find a pair of special branch officers waiting for him, with a lot of awkward questions about a man called Hanrahan.*

*[Previously in episode 2]
[In the hotel room]*

Mayer: Well, if there’s no further business, will you both get the hell out of here and let me have my room back?
McNeil: There’s just one more thing, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Let’s hear it then.
McNeil: Remember, nobody knows what this Hanrahan looks like, nobody knows what name he’s travelling under, so keep your door locked, and don’t let anyone in you don’t know.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> In the merry month of May in the year 1902, Mount Palais on the island of Martinique blew up. In the capital, Saint-Pierre, only two of the 30,000 population survived. One was a convict, and the other a madman, and they survived because they were both locked up in cells. While I was trying to decide whether I was criminal or crazy…

[In the hotel room]*

Mayer: Hello?
Coleman: Is that you, Mayer?
Mayer: I’m not sure.
Coleman: What a terribly bizarre thing to say.
Mayer: We live in a terribly bizarre world.
Coleman: How’s the weather up there?
Mayer: Poised between bad and worse.
Coleman: You sound as cross as two sticks, dear boy.
Mayer: Does the name Hanrahan mean anything to you?
Coleman: Not a thing.
Mayer: Have the police been on to you about me?
Coleman: Have you been sampling the local brew, Mayer?
Mayer: How did you know I was here, Coleman?
Coleman: Intuition, perhaps.
Mayer: Did Forrest tell you?
Coleman: No.
Mayer: Teresa, perhaps?
Coleman: My dear boy, Teresa wouldn’t tell me the time if she had two watches. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to speak to her.
Mayer: What makes you think she’s with me?
Coleman: A rather melodramatic note she left, saying she was going up to Glasgow.
Mayer: See me?
Coleman: Well, I’d rather assume.
Mayer: Why was the note melodramatic?
Coleman: There was a little unpleasantness here yesterday which I’d rather not discuss.
Mayer: Look, Coleman, I’m only someone that’s been hired to do a job. I refuse to become involved, nor have I been involved to any greater extent than that. Do I make myself clear?
Coleman: Tell Teresa I called.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Supermarket empires grow from primitive small village shops to multinational magnificence. Yet Lord Meatpaste, interviewed last night on television, declined to credit his success to monetarism, capitalism or any otherism. Nor did he admit to more than usual ambition, to more than usual greed. The truth is, he told ten million viewers: “I got out of that small shop to avoid becoming embroiled in the dreary lives of my customers.”
> 
> 
> I threw myself on the bed that looked as though a computer made it every morning. Lord Meatpaste, Lord Meatpaste, I whimpered, where are you when I need you?
> 
> When I woke up it was dark, and so was the taste in my mouth. And I lay for a moment, meditating on the ultimate room service, where you could send out your problems, bafflements, complexes, and in due course have them returned to you, solved and neatly folded. And it occurred to me, depressingly, that somewhere, someone was already working on it.
> 
> And feeling vaguely defeated, I took the lift to the ground floor and the dining room.
> 

*[In the hotel dining room]*

Receptionist: Are you a resident, sir?
Mayer: Yes.
Receptionist: Could I have your name, sir?
Mayer: Mayer.
Receptionist: Ah, yes, yes. You timed it nicely, sir.
Mayer: I did?
Receptionist: Yes, the young lady has just arrived.
Mayer: Then we’d better not keep her waiting.
Receptionist: This way, sir.
Mayer: Hello, Teresa.
Teresa: Sit down, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: How long have you been in Glasgow?
Teresa: Since last night.
Mayer: So what have we done? Ill-hoped?
Teresa: I’m not in the mood for jokes, Mayer.
Mayer: I’ll make you an offer.
Teresa: Let’s hear it.
Mayer: I’ll tell you what’s been happening up here, you tell me what’s been happening in London.
Teresa: Terrible things have been happening in London.
Mayer: Shall we talk about them first?
Teresa: I hardly know where to begin.
Mayer: You could begin with the rather melodramatic note Jocelyn Coleman says you left.
Teresa: Was that how he described it?
Mayer: His very words.
Teresa: Nasty old queen.
Mayer: There’s something you haven’t told me.
Teresa: You’re too cool, Mayer. Too bloody cool by half.
Mayer: Maybe that’s because I find myself caught up with such a bloody preposterous family.
Teresa: Maybe we’re preposterous because we have never really been a family at all.
Mayer: And what particular bones am I supposed to pick out of that?
Teresa: Why not accept it at face value?
Mayer: Is it so very painful to talk about?
Teresa: Who am I, Mayer? Who am I?
Mayer: Take it easy. Tell me about this note Coleman mentioned.
Teresa: It was a note to my grandfather telling him I was going to Glasgow because of something I had just found out about Coleman.
Mayer: And what was that?
Teresa: That he was selling off my grandfather’s paintings. And I knew someone up here who could prove it.
Mayer: Did you tackle Coleman about this?
Teresa: Yes.
Mayer: What happened?
Teresa: There was a blazing row. And that was when he said he knew things about my grandfather that would send him to prison for the rest of his life. And if the truth were known, he wasn’t my grandfather at all.
Mayer: Coleman actually said that in so many words?

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> She got up and fled. Leaving me hostage to the imaginations of the diners at the nearby tables. I made no attempt to follow her. Content to sit there, ignoring the amusement, the disapproval, or whatever form of schadenfreude affected those who watched her sudden departure.
> 
> 
> So I sat on, thinking of the sadness of being a teenager, the melancholy of knowing nothing in practice. And I suddenly felt sorry for Teresa. But not much.
> 
> After a while it became obvious that she was not coming back. I grew bored with yuppie faces. Young men with a kind of smooth suppleness, and all the calculating charm of well-groomed pickpockets, wearing their women like perfumed credit cards.
> 
> So I went back to my room. And made a telephone call.

*[In the hotel room]
[On the phone]*

Arnold: Mayer Book Service?
Mayer: Ah, Arnold. I wondered how you were getting on.
Arnold: Oh, learning all the time. Mr Mayer?
Mayer: Yes?
Arnold: Is there a book called The Homosexual Kings of England?
Mayer: There is.
Arnold: Is it a rare book?
Mayer: Not particularly.
Arnold: There was this old lady…
Mayer: Miss Hitler, I call her.
Arnold: Small, quiet-spoken, about 70, expensive tweets.
Mayer: That’s her, all right. Every bookseller in London knows her. She goes round to the mall, always hunting down the same book.
Arnold: What’s so special about gay monarchs?
Mayer: I think she finds them untidy, wants to put them back in the closet.
Arnold: You mean she destroys the books?
Mayer: That’s why we call her Miss Hitler.
Arnold: Oh, Mr Mayer?
Mayer: What is it, Arnold?
Arnold: Teresa’s up there with you, isn’t she?
Mayer: Teresa is up here. Teresa is not with me.
Arnold: Sorry, it’s none of my business.
Mayer: What were you going to say about Teresa?
Arnold: Does she know that her grandfather collapsed this evening? He’s been taken to hospital?

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I called reception and asked for her room number, then sat around trying to compose a formula of words that would somehow make palatable what could never be anything else than unpalatable.
> 
> 
> But when I called her room, there was no reply. And just as I hung up, there came a knock at the door, and I went and swung it open, and found myself staring at two strangers. They were both as blonde as peroxide could make them, both dressed in current teenage black, that made them look like jolly undertakers.
> 
> They swaggered past me into the room, and then the boy spoke.

*[In the hotel room]*

Pat: Go on, say it.
Mayer: Say what?
Pat: Say what you’re thinking.
Mayer: Consider it said.
Paula: You’re supposed to say we look like the Midwich Cuckoos.
Mayer: Are you sure you’ve got the right person?
Pat: Your name’s Mayer, isn’t it?
Mayer: Right.
Paula: Grandson of Big Gus Mayer?
Mayer: I don’t usually think of myself in that way, but right again.
Pat: Jeez, for a minute I thought that old Henderson had got it wrong.
Mayer: Ah.
Pat: You know who we are now?
Mayer: You’re the two with the Spanish War project?
Pat: That’s right. We’re trying to get Channel 4 money.
Mayer: I thought Henderson was talking about a school project.
Pat: You must be joking. School is where they murder you and send the boy to university to be embalmed. You like the idea of a Spanish War movie?
Mayer: Great.
Paula: Pat and I represent New Wave Scottish Cinema.
Mayer: Delighted to make his acquaintance.
Pat: Paula is the director, and I’m the producer.
Mayer: And old Henderson?
Pat: He says he intends to come to our opening night. He asked us to apologise to you.
Mayer: For what?
Pat: I think he felt he’d been a bit short with you.
Mayer: I thought he was a tired old man.
Pat: Well, maybe he picked up the vibrations.
Mayer: Maybe he did.
Pat: Anyway, he asked us to pass on this information about Jock Cameron.
Mayer: Yes?
Pat: The last he heard, Cameron was working in a building site near Kettering.
Mayer: How long ago?
Pat: About four years. Old Henderson reckons he’s moved on since.
Mayer: Oh, great.
Pat: He wrote down this name and address for you. He says if anyone knows where Jock Cameron is, it’s likely to be her.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> And off they went, the Midwich Cuckoos, carrying lightly their self-appointed burden of Scottish Cinema Mark II, their hopes as bright as their hair.
> 
> 
> I looked at the shred of paper they had left me, which looked as though it had been carelessly torn from a child’s exercise book.
> 
> It bore in pencil a name and an address and a telephone number.

*[In the hotel room]
[On the phone]*

McLauchlan: Agnes McLauchlan speaking.
Mayer: My name is Mayer, Mrs McLauchlan.
McLauchlan: Miss McLauchlan.
Mayer: I beg your pardon?
McLauchlan: What did you say your name was?
Mayer: Mayer. M-A-Y-E-R.
McLauchlan: I don’t think I’ve ever known anyone with that name.
Mayer: Miss McLaughlin, your name has been given me.
McLauchlan: Oh, dear. You’re not going to offer me a gold Rolls Royce or a holiday in Tenerife for two or something equally ridiculous?
Mayer: Nothing like that.
McLauchlan: Who gave you my name anyway, Mr Mayer?
Mayer: A Mr Henderson.
McLauchlan: Oh, I know several Mr Hendersons.
Mayer: This one lives in the Valleyfield residential home.
McLauchlan: Oh, that’ll be Huey Henderson. Now, what can I do to assist you, Mr Mayer?
Mayer: I’m trying to find a man called Jock Cameron.
McLauchlan: Yes?
Mayer: Mr Henderson said that if anyone was likely to know where Cameron was, it was you.
McLauchlan: I see.
Mayer: I’m not a policeman, Miss McLaughlin.
McLauchlan: What else are you not?
Mayer: Well, I’m not from the DHSS, and I’m not from the Inland Revenue, and I’m not a hitman from the Mafia.
McLauchlan: Tell the truth and shame the devil, Mr Mayer. What are you?
Mayer: I’m a bookseller.
McLauchlan: Oh, well, this I must hear about.
Mayer: Whenever it’s convenient.
McLauchlan: Why don’t you come along now?
Mayer: If you’re sure it’s not too late.
McLauchlan: At my age, Mr Mayer, beauty sleep is no longer a consideration. You have the address?
Mayer: Great Western Road.
McLauchlan: See if you can pick up a pint of milk somewhere.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> The taxi man found a late-night shop, and we bought milk from a sleepy Indian. Then we were on a wide, wide road that surged into the darkness. A public road that still managed to convey an air of conscious worth and almost pharisaical privacy, which even got to the taxi driver.
> 

*[In the taxi]*

Taxi Driver: Been in Glasgow before, Jimmy?
Mayer: First time.
Taxi Driver: You know you’ve gone to a famous address.
Mayer: What’s famous about it?
Taxi Driver: It’s a listed building.
Mayer: Really?
Taxi Driver: Designed by Greek Thompson.
Mayer: Do I get thrown out of the cab if I say I’ve never heard of him?
Taxi Driver: Well, not in this economic climate.
Mayer: Who was he, anyway?
Taxi Driver: Ah, he’s a headbanger. Victorian architect. Everything he designed turned out to be a Greek temple.
Mayer: Including this place I’m going?
Taxi Driver: Ah, it’s no surprise. Matter of fact, I quite like it.
Mayer: What kind of people live in Greek Thompson buildings?
Taxi Driver: People with old money.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> The taxi deposited me at the foot of a row of steps and then shot off as though unwittingly it was trespassing on something 2,000 years earlier than itself.
> 
> 
> I climbed the steps towards the Corinthian pillars that stood on either side of the doorway like sentinels that had been turned to stone. As I reached the door, it opened with a strange whirring sound and let me into an enormous hall that was tiled in black and white.
> 
> She was standing in that huge hall, small and dumpy, like a miniature chess piece on an overgrown chessboard. Her face was smooth, her hair neatly tended. She was very much her own lady in her own house.
> 

*[In McLauchlan’s house]*

McLauchlan: Ah, you managed to get some milk.
Mayer: Glasgow seems to have an abundance of handy little late-night shops.
McLauchlan: Well, let’s go into the kitchen, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Thank you.
McLauchlan: I spend most of my time in here.
Mayer: You live alone in this enormous house?
McLauchlan: I rent out the top two floors. Not quite what you expected, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Let’s say I don’t see Jock Cameron here.
McLauchlan: Jock Cameron has never set foot in this house.
Mayer: But you knew him?
McLauchlan: At one time, I knew Jock Cameron’s body more intimately than I knew my own.
Mayer: You were…
McLauchlan: No, Mr Mayer. We were not.
Mayer: Perhaps you’d better tell this in your own way, Miss McLauchlan.
McLauchlan: Yeah, perhaps it might be better.
McLauchlan: Oh, wait. Please sit down.
Mayer: Thank you.
McLauchlan: How much do you know about Jock Cameron?
Mayer: Very little, actually. I’ve seen a letter.
McLauchlan: What kind of picture do you have of Jock Cameron?
Mayer: I see him as a superb fighting soldier.
McLauchlan: Superb fighting soldiers are ten a penny. Cameron was something more.
Mayer: How much more?
McLauchlan: I don’t want to sound like an old woman rambling on.
Mayer: We agreed you should tell this in your own way.
McLauchlan: In that case, let me make you some coffee.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Everything she did, all her movements, everything was deft, precise, economical, in a strange way, unsentimental.
> 
> 
> She was at one with herself, had not let life rule her and not dreamed futile dreams, had not demanded more than was on offer. She had balanced her giving with her taking and had therefore aged well. She still believed in something and if that something turned out to be God, then fair enough. And if it didn’t, well, as the man said, what’s in a name?
> 

*[In McLauchlan’s house]*

McLauchlan: The first time I saw Jock Cameron was in Kingston, Jamaica.
Mayer: Thank you. That would be about 1930.
McLauchlan: Oh, you know about that.
Mayer: Only from books. That’s why talking to you is so valuable. Everybody else seemed to assume I would get it all from books.
McLauchlan: Well, a lot of it is on record.
Mayer: Miss McLaughlin, I feel closer to Jock Cameron in this house than I ever have done.
McLauchlan: I think that’s the nicest thing that’s been said to me this long time.
Mayer: I understand that Cameron was in the British Army at that time.
McLauchlan: He was. And he was court-martialed and found guilty of mutiny. Oh, there was a strong feeling that he was made the scapegoat.
Mayer: What were you doing in Kingston at the time, Miss McLauchlan?
McLauchlan: My father was an army officer.
Mayer: Ah. Was he sympathetic to Cameron?
McLauchlan: Oh, far from it. My father was a very harsh and limited man. He believed in King’s regulations the way better men believed in the Bible. I don’t think they breed people like him any more. I wouldn’t be too sure of that. I sincerely hope you’re wrong.
Mayer: You said you saw Cameron in Kingston?
McLauchlan: Once.
Mayer: Can you remember the occasion?
McLauchlan: It was the day they sent him off the island to start his prison sentence in the UK. I was down at the harbour watching the black kids diving for pennies. And suddenly I heard this commotion and ran over to see what was happening.

*[In McLauchlan’s memory in the past]*

*[Background sound]
(Left, right, left, right.)
(Bags of swagger.)
(Bags of swank.)*

*[In McLauchlan’s house]*

McLauchlan: About a dozen of them with fixed bayonets escorting this one man. Then they halted at the gangway. And this dangerous man looked straight at me. I was holding a flower. I remember a bright red thing. He looked at it and smiled. That’s a bonny flower you’ve got there, hen, he said. Suddenly, I don’t ask me why, I threw the flower to him. He caught it and then he was hustled onto the ship. My father heard about the flower and gave me a terrible thrashing.
Mayer: Did you ever meet Cameron again?
McLauchlan: Seven years later.
Mayer: Where?
McLauchlan: Harama.
Mayer: What were you doing there?
McLauchlan: Oh, I was a nurse.
Mayer: A nurse?
McLauchlan: I thought we were talking about Jock Cameron.
Mayer: We still are, in a way.
McLauchlan: Shall I save you from saying something foolish?
Mayer: If you feel you must.
McLauchlan: Oh, I do, I do. Any moment now we’ll be getting all that claptrap about my background, my advantages and being worthy of better things.
Mayer: All right, then. Why did you become a nurse?
McLauchlan: I suppose becoming a nurse was my form of mutiny. I think that when you’re brought up the way I was, you soon saw the darker side of empire, the hypocrisy behind the white man’s burden, the greed and arrogance at the back of pomp and circumstance. So you were making a deliberate political choice. I became a nurse to escape from a thoroughly repressive family background, which I am not prepared to discuss any further.
Mayer: I’m sorry.
McLauchlan: Fine.
Mayer: So the second time you met Cameron was in Spain.
McLauchlan: It was hard not to.
Mayer: He was all over the place.
McLauchlan: I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone with such energy.
Mayer: But you still managed to see quite a lot of him.
McLauchlan: Well, he kept getting wounded and you seemed to be batching him up.
Mayer: Did you ever mention the flower to him?
McLauchlan: No, I never did. Nor did he ever mention it to me.
Mayer: Not consistent with his macho image, perhaps?
McLauchlan: No. That is unworthy of you, Mr Mayer. Let me tell you what happened near a place called Brunetti.

*[In McLauchlan’s memory in the past]*

McLauchlan: What’s bothering you?
Cameron: Can I have a wee word with you?
McLauchlan: Right, Cameron. What’s on your mind?
Cameron: I’ve found a baby.
McLauchlan: You’ve what?
Cameron: I’ve found a baby.
McLauchlan: Oh, I could walk outside and find a dozen abandoned babies in five minutes.
Cameron: They seem special, but…
McLauchlan: Well, they all are.
Cameron: Well, I delivered them myself.
McLauchlan: Oh, dammit, Cameron. Is there no end to your versatility?
Cameron: I can turn my hunting mace things if I have to.
McLauchlan: So it would appear. Where did this happen?
Cameron: In a shell hole.
McLauchlan: Where else? What was a pregnant woman doing in a shell hole anyway?
Cameron: Killing fascists.
McLauchlan: I’m assuming that she’s dead.
Cameron: I couldn’t get the bleeding stopped.
McLauchlan: Well, what do you intend doing with the child?
Cameron: I’d like you to look after him for a wee while.
McLauchlan: For how long?
Cameron: Until I arrange to get him to Scotland somewhere or other.
McLauchlan: Look, Cameron, that might not be easy.
Cameron: I’ll manage.

*[In McLauchlan’s house]*

Mayer: Did he manage?
McLauchlan: Oh, yes, he managed all right. But what happened to him after that, Mr Mayer, is somebody else’s story. Whoever that somebody else is.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> As I walked away from the theatrical steps of Greek Thompson’s listed building, an iconoclastic Glasgow moon shrugged aside a curtain of tattered clouds and cast a cold northern light on its pillared pomposity, making it seem more Thompson than Greek. I found it suddenly gym crack, spurious, an unreal domicile for an old lady who had known real blood, real suffering, and real death.
> 
> 
> You always know when you’re being watched. Some ancient instinct spreads its slow tension, preparing your body for an unseen treachery. The thrust of a knife, the whistle of a spear, the sudden crack of a gun. Eyes focused on you like a burning glass.
> 
> My mind was flooded with violent sounds and images, which had the odd effect of destroying surprise when the car drew up beside me.
> 

*[Outside McLauchlan’s house]*

Norah: Do you like walking in the rain, Mr Mayer?
Mayer: It’s an eccentricity I share with Greta Garbo.
McNeil: We want to talk to you, smart-ass.
Mayer: You could refuse such a gracious invitation.
McNeil: Get into the car.
Norah: Rather late for visiting, Mr Mayer?
Mayer: I thought so too, but she insisted.
McNeil: Who is she?
Mayer: My old nanny.
Norah: Patience is a virtue, Mr Mayer, one that Inspector McNeill is not noted for.
Mayer: Spoken like a true honours graduate.
McNeil: I’m not an honours graduate, Mayer.
Mayer: Not even battle honours.
McNeil: You’re not as clever as you think you are, Mayer.
Mayer: It only looks like that in the present distinguished company.
McNeil: In a moment I’m going to drag you outside this car and beat the hell out of you.
Mayer: The last reason of the king is the sword.
Norah: It doesn’t have to be.
Mayer: But you’d stand by and watch it happen?
Norah: If necessary.
Mayer: What happens if I turn out to be an honours graduate in karate?
Norah: Somebody else will be along to ask the questions. Somebody better equipped. Well, what’s it to be?
Mayer: The lady I was visiting is called Miss MacLachlan.
McNeil: There are other names on the door.
Mayer: She rents out the top two floors.
Norah: She’s an old friend of yours?
Mayer: I met her for the first time tonight.
McNeil: Why were you visiting her?
Mayer: Business.
Norah: That covers a multitude of sins, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Oh, no sins at all.
McNeil: What was your business?
Mayer: Well, if you check me out, you’ll know that I run a bookshop. It’s called The Bookworm.
McNeil: We know all that.
Mayer: I also run a sideline in rare and unusual books.
McNeil: Pornography, eh?
Mayer: I’m afraid you’ll have to go elsewhere for that.
Norah: For God’s sake, will you stop it, you two?
Mayer: Tell him to stay inside his warrant card.
Norah: Can we get back to your reason for visiting Miss MacLachlan?
Mayer: Her father was a military man, a career soldier. Not famous or distinguished as a soldier, but modestly celebrated in book-selling circles for his collection of books on military history. Specialist stuff, but extremely valuable. When he was called to the Great War office in the sky, Miss MacLachlan fell heir to the collection. But until now, she has managed to keep it intact.
Norah: And this collection is the reason that brings you up here?
Mayer: That’s the main reason. Apparently, she’s been having a rough time financially over the past few years, and the word is out that she might now be prepared to let the collection go if the right offer was forthcoming. I came up to check this out, you see, and put in a bid if the rumour turned out to be true.
McNeil: We have ways of confirming this, Mayer.
Mayer: Be my guest.
Norah: You said that this collection of books was the main reason for coming up here. That suggests there were others.
Mayer: They probably don’t matter.
McNeil: We’re not interested in probabilities, Mayer.
Mayer: Possibly not, but I’m sure you’d be even less interested in the fact that I felt I had been working too hard and owed myself a break.
Norah: Who is JC, Mr Mayer?
Mayer: JC?
Norah: Yes.
Mayer: Jeremiah Clark, Jiminy Crickets, Joan Collins?
McNeil: We’re talking about postcards.
Mayer: Postcards?
McNeil: Found in your hotel room. All addressed to the same person, and all signed by the same person.
Norah: JC.
Mayer: Oh, Jock Cameron.
McNeil: Ah.
Mayer: You probably came across a list of names, too.
McNeil: We did.
Mayer: I hope you’ll find it more useful than I did.
Norah: Jock Cameron, Mr Mayer.
McNeil: What is your interest in him, Mayer?
Mayer: I suppose you might call it purely academic.
Norah: In what way?
Mayer: What do you know about the Spanish Civil War?
Norah: Not a lot.
Mayer: Surely you must at least have heard of a book called For Whom the Bell Tolls?
Norah: Of course. Mayer: And I once had a dog called Ernest Hemingway.
Mayer: A bull terrier, no doubt.
McNeil: What the hell has all this to do with Cameron?
Mayer: Jock Cameron fought in the Spanish Civil War, with great distinction.
Norah: Mr Mayer, are all booksellers as long-winded as you?
Mayer: I’m trying to give you the complete picture.
McNeil: We’ll settle for the postcards.
Mayer: Well, the postcards belong to a friend of mine who’s a kind of Spanish Civil War buff. For years now, he’s had this ambition to write a biography of Jock Cameron. He met Cameron, who raised no objection, but then the trouble began.
McNeil: What trouble?
Mayer: Well, you see, Cameron’s something of a wandering boy, always on the move, here, there, everywhere. My friend could never pin him down long enough in one place for any useful discussion to take place. Cameron kept in touch with him by postcard. Here I am in Swansea, or Drumner Drocket, or wherever. Fascinating but useless for what my friend had in mind.
Norah: What about the list of names?
Mayer: Cameron was with the International Brigade in Spain. So were all the people on that list.
McNeil: This friend of yours supplied you with a list?
Mayer: Right.
McNeil: Why?
Mayer: The idea was that one of them might know where Cameron is now.
Norah: How many of them did you visit?
Mayer: One, an old sourpuss called Henderson.
Norah: Did you get anything from him?
Mayer: Only a flea in my ear.
McNeil: So you have no idea where Cameron is?
Mayer: No more than you appear to have.
Norah: There’s something you should know, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Really?
Norah: It’s about the postcards.
Mayer: Yes?
Norah: Each of these postcards came from a place where there’d been a bomb outrage.
Mayer: Coincidence, perhaps?
Norah: The postmarks indicate that they were posted round about the dates of the bombings.
McNeil: That, Mayer, is why we want to talk to Jock Cameron.

## Episode 4

*Narrator:*

*“Castles in Spain”, a serial in five parts by Edward Boyd, with Ray Brooks as Grahame Mayer. Episode four.*

*Graham Mayer has been hired under strange circumstances to find a missing veteran of the Spanish Civil War. His search for the elusive and possibly dangerous Jock Cameron has taken him north to Glasgow where he’s begun to track down a list of people who knew Cameron in Spain during the late 1930s and who may know where he is now. The trouble is that wherever Mayer goes, two mysterious police officers are never far behind.*

[Outside McLauchlan’s house]*

Norah: There’s something you should know, Mr Mayer.
Mayer: Really?
Norah: It’s about the postcards.
Mayer: Yes?
Norah: Each of these postcards came from a place where there’d been a bomb outrage.
Mayer: Coincidence perhaps?
Norah: The postmarks indicate that they were posted round about the dates of the bombings.
McNeil: That, Mayer, is why we want to talk to Jock Cameron.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> They let me out of the car and I walked back to the hotel. A fine rain was falling and I reflected that I’d discovered something new but not about Jock Cameron. I’d unearthed new depths of duplicity in myself of which I was at once both proud and fearful. And in this state of streaky euphoria, I walked glistening into the bar.
> 
> 
> I recognised him at once. He looked just as little, just as nice as he had done sitting beside me on the plane. Centuries ago, it seemed.
> 

*[In the hotel bar]*

Millhouse: Remember me?
Mayer: The password is Emily Twelveries.
Millhouse: Never heard of her.
Mayer: She was your great aunt and she wrote a book, she said.
Millhouse: You want to remain my friend?
Mayer: Until something better offers.
Millhouse: Don’t ever read that book. Don’t ever, ever read that book.
Mayer: What’s it called?
Millhouse: I swore a mighty oath on a stack of Bibles never to tell anybody that.
Mayer: You make it sound irresistible.
Millhouse: Guess where I’ve been tonight?
Mayer: Where?
Millhouse: A pop concert.
Mayer: You’ll be smirking next.
Millhouse: Oh, look who’s here.
Mayer: Who the devil is that?
Millhouse: That, my friend, is Apollyon.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Apollyon the Destroyer, the ferocious devil of St. John the Divine. This was the enemy of mankind. But bowdlerized, his fangs extracted, talons cut, his power diminished, reduced to a demon in a sleazy pantomime. He was wearing a scarlet jerkin and flame-colored tights. His boots were ankle length and red. And his hair was cunningly lacquered into two rather unconvincing horns.
> 
> He had an entourage of two, which might mean that even devils are cutting back on things these days.
> 
> One was standard B-movie thug. The other was a girl called Teresa.
> 

*[In the hotel bar]*

Millhouse: Well, bookseller, does he make your blood run cold?
Mayer: Not so as anyone would notice.
Millhouse: His real name’s Maguire, Terrence Maguire.
Mayer: You seem to know a lot about him.
Millhouse: I invented him.
Mayer: The girl with him?
Millhouse: Eh, not your run-of-the-mill groupie, I’d have said.
Mayer: I know her.
Millhouse: Not to worry. Apollyon isn’t into girls.
Mayer: That’s the least of my worries. But I must talk to her.
Millhouse: Well, ain’t the coin a phrase, bookseller? There’s no time like the present.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I walked across the bar to where Teresa sat, pinioned between a pastiche B. Algebra and his B-movie minder. I sat down beside them, uninvited, and was immediately coned by three surprised and hostile stares.
> 

*[In the hotel bar]*

Teresa: What do you want?
Mayer: I’ve been looking all over for you.
Teresa: Why?
Mayer: We have things to talk about.
Teresa: Not just now.
Mayer: Right now, in private.
Teresa: Not just now.
Mayer: I must insist.
Apollyon: Apollyon doesn’t like that word, mister.
Mayer: Too many syllables in it, maybe.
Apollyon: Smart boy, eh?
Nuke: This boy botherin’ you, Apollyon?
Apollyon: What’s your name, mister?
Teresa: His name’s Mayer.
Apollyon: Mayer, I think it’s time you met Nuke Winter.
Nuke: I’m Apollyon’s minder.
Apollyon: You know what a minder is, mister?
Mayer: Some kind of hired bully, isn’t it?
Apollyon: That’s right.
Nuke: Your jacket’s hangin’ in a shaky nail, by the way.
Apollyon: It’s up to you, Mayer. Either go away or stay and get Nuked.
Mayer: I’ll stay. I must talk to Teresa.
Millhouse: And so you shall, Mr Bookseller.
Apollyon: Mr Millhouse.
Millhouse: Well, Maguire.
Apollyon: Great to see you, Mr Millhouse.
Millhouse: I’m sorry I can’t return the compliment.
Apollyon: Is anything wrong, Mr Millhouse?
Millhouse: I caught your show tonight.
Apollyon: Great audience. They loved me.
Millhouse: You were terrible. Who are you, Maguire? And where are you from?
Apollyon: Look, Mr Millhouse…
Millhouse: The question was rhetorical. I know only too well who you are and where you’re from. What’s bothering me at the moment is where you’re going, if anywhere.
Apollyon: Can I say something, Mr Millhouse?
Millhouse: No, you can’t. Where was the bass player tonight?
Apollyon: I dropped him.
Millhouse: Why? Was he drunk? Stoned? Strung out in any way I’ve missed?
Apollyon: We had a disagreement about the music.
Millhouse: I want him back in the group.
Apollyon: Yes, Mr Millhouse.
Millhouse: The only musician in the group. The only one who knows B-flat from a bull’s foot, and you go and drop him.
Apollyon: I’m sorry, Mr Millhouse.
Teresa: You don’t have to take this, Maguire.
Apollyon: Shut up, Teresa.
Teresa: Don’t talk to me like that.
Apollyon: You don’t understand.
Teresa: I understand this much. If you’re prepared to sit here and let this character walk all over you, great. But I don’t have to sit and listen to it.
Apollyon: Then get lost.
Teresa: If you still want to talk to me, Mayer, I’ll see you in the morning.
Mayer: Good night, Teresa.
Millhouse: Have I made myself clear, Maguire?
Apollyon: Yes, Mr Millhouse. I’ll phone the bass player in the morning.
Millhouse: Phone him tonight.
Apollyon: Will do, Mr Millhouse.
Millhouse: Now, let’s have a talk about you, Nuke. Or Puke, whatever your name is.
Nuke: Nuke, Mr Millhouse.
Millhouse: Where did Maguire find you?
Nuke: Terry and me was at school together.
Millhouse: Uh-huh.
Nuke: St. Benedict’s High.
Millhouse: Now, how do you see your job as minder, Nuke?
Nuke: Seeing that Terry, I mean, Apollyon, and, is to get hassled.
Millhouse: Admirable, but just a little vague. Shall I tell you how I see it?
Nuke: I’m always willing to learn, Mr Millhouse.
Millhouse: Your job is to protect Maguire from silly little boys or girls who want to tear his clothes off or smuggle themselves into his guitar case.
Nuke: Uh-huh.
Millhouse: Occasionally, you might even have to foil an assassination attempt by a maddened music lover.
Nuke: Uh-huh.
Millhouse: What is not in your contract is leaning on people like my friend, Mr Mayer, here.
Nuke: Oh, I didn’t know he was a mate of yours.
Millhouse: The world’s full of mates of mine.
Nuke: I’ll remember that, Mr Millhouse.
Millhouse: That goes for you, too, Maguire.
Apollyon: Yes, Mr Millhouse.
Millhouse: Right, Nuke, take him home and put him to bed. Sing him a lullaby. Give him a glass of hot milk. Read Rupert Bear to him or whatever. And before you put the light out, remember everything I’ve told you.
Nuke: Whatever you say, Mr Millhouse.
Millhouse: Say goodnight, Maguire.
Apollyon: Goodnight, Mr Millhouse.
*[Apollyon and Nuke leave]*
Mayer: Weren’t you a bit hard on him?
Millhouse: Not as hard as Nuke would have been on you.
Mayer: I owe you for that.
Millhouse: No, I think nothing of it.
Mayer: Has he any talent?
Millhouse: None at all. None of them have.
Mayer: Oh, come on.
Millhouse: It’s true. Pop music is the great 20th century confidence trick.
Mayer: You get nothing from it, personally?
Millhouse: Only money.
Mayer: I feel almost sorry for that posturing idiot.
Millhouse: Don’t. If he makes it big, he’ll treat me a damn sight worse than I ever treated him.
Mayer: And you’d accept that?
Millhouse: No way.
Mayer: What would you do?
Millhouse: Sell him. I might even let him buy himself back.
Mayer: What happens if he doesn’t make it?
Millhouse: He can go back to coloring in holy pictures.
Mayer: You frighten me, Mr Millhouse.
Millhouse: Go to bed, bookseller. Dream of hearts and flowers.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I went upstairs to my room, feeling like an endangered species, which perhaps I was. I pulled back the curtains and let the city lights stare up at me unblinkingly. They made patterns which told me nothing. Shapes without content. Flickers of function. Neon nothingness. The reflected comment wrote itself on the low clouds, announcing with a kind of bleak pride, mankind is a failed experiment. I closed the curtains to shut off the past, the present, and the even more dreadful future.
> 
> 
> Then somebody knocked quietly on my door. And when I opened it, there was Teresa.
> 

*[In the hotel room]*

Teresa: May I come in?
Mayer: I thought we had an appointment for tomorrow morning.
Teresa: It’s tomorrow morning now.
Mayer: Technically, I suppose you’re right. Come in then. Sit down.
Teresa: Who was that horrible little man, Millhouse?
Mayer: He apparently buys and sells pop stars.
Teresa: Where did you meet him?
Mayer: On the plane coming up here.
Teresa: Is that true?
Mayer: No, it’s not true. He’s a colonel in the KGB. So am I. We’re all colonels in the KGB. There’s a lot of ill feeling about it. Too many chiefs and too few Indians is the main complaint.
Teresa: You don’t have to shout at me.
Mayer: I’m not shouting at you.
Teresa: Yes, you are.
Mayer: I’m not going to argue with you.
Teresa: Do you know that my grandfather is dead?
Mayer: I’m sorry. My news for you was only that he’d been taken to hospital.
Teresa: Then your news is out of date.
Mayer: Who told you?
Teresa: Arnold. Just now.
Mayer: He’s a fast man with my phone bill as Arnold.
Teresa: What do you intend to do now, bookseller?
Mayer: Cut my losses, go back home.
Teresa: Lucky you.
Mayer: Oh, come on. You’re not going to give me that little orphan Annie routine again, are you?
Teresa: You bastard.
Mayer: That remark is all the charm of a redundancy notice.
Teresa: I didn’t mean–
Mayer: Are you still mad about the way Millhouse treated your pantomime dame?
Teresa: Why should I be?
Mayer: That depends on how close you are to Maguire.
Teresa: He’s just someone I knew in London.
Mayer: Someone who painted holy pictures.
Teresa: How did you know that?
Mayer: Millhouse mentioned something about it.
Teresa: What else did he mention?
Mayer: There was the merest suggestion that he might be gay.
Teresa: They’re all gay. Maguire, my grandfather, that old queen, Jocelyn.
Mayer: Hold on a minute. Who told you about your grandfather being gay?
Teresa: What does that matter?
Mayer: It matters for various reasons.
Teresa: I’d like to hear them.
Mayer: To begin with, it just might not be true.
Teresa: But Jocelyn said–
Mayer: Forget Coleman for a moment. Did your grandfather ever at any time take you aside and say, “Teresa, darling, I’ve just come out of the closet and I want you to be the first to know.”
Teresa: Don’t be silly.
Mayer: I take it that means no.
Teresa: Correct.
Mayer: Then it all comes back to Jocelyn, doesn’t it?
Teresa: I suppose so. He scares me. I think he always has done. I’m going to bed. Good night, Mr Mayer.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I have a bedside book that goes everywhere with me. I picked it up in Hastings when I was 17. It has shared my sleeplessness ever since. It is a slim volume called Hydra Taphia which is Sir Thomas Brown’s way of indicating that he can throw a dead language around with the best of them. In English, it comes out as Earn Burial. And the book fell open at one of my favorite passages which goes as follows:
> *What song the siren sang or what name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women, though puzzling questions are not beyond all conjecture.*
> 
> 
> So I lay in that overheated room conjecturing. Was Achilles another gay warrior like Julius Caesar, like Richard the Lionheart, like William of Orange, like question mark, Teresa’s grandfather?
> 
> Morning brought sunshine and a day borrowed from spring or perhaps repaid. And I went downstairs to find the astonishing Mr Millhouse booted and spurred for departure.
> 

*[In the hotel foyer]*

Millhouse: Ah, good morning, bookseller. Come to see me off?
Mayer: Where to this time?
Millhouse: Back to the smoke next week in New York.
Mayer: Happy jet lag.
Millhouse: Bless you.
Mayer: Can I ask you one final favor?
Millhouse: Ask.
Mayer: Where can I find Maguire?
Millhouse: That’s a favor.
Mayer: Who knows?
Millhouse: OK. Here you are, my card. That way you get two addresses for the price of one.
Mayer: My lucky day.
Millhouse: Well, off we go into the wild blue yonder. Ciao, bookseller.
Mayer: Ciao.
Millhouse: If you fancy Maguire, I won’t be hard to deal with.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> He went off through the swing doors, a jaunty indomitable little man who chased money around the world and would almost certainly one day find it.
> 
> 
> So I went searching for Teresa and not finding her, decided to call on Maguire who was known to the trade as Apollyon. He lived in Garnet Hill which was a real hill even if somewhat lacking in garnets. Once it had been a famous place for theatrical digs. Now it was Glasgow’s Chinatown and five exquisite little dolls watched with a comic solemnity as I entered the close where Maguire lived. And I climbed the tiny stairs until I arrived at a green and white striped door which bore the name: Apollyon.
> 

*[In Apollyon (*Maguire*)’s flat]*

Apollyon: You’re beginning to bug me, man.
Mayer: Does that mean you’re going to summon Nuke?
Apollyon: Nuke’s gone to his meditation class.
Mayer: No comment.
Apollyon: What do you want?
Mayer: Do you believe in intuition?
Apollyon: You can’t make money out of it.
Mayer: Don’t bet on that.
Apollyon: You’re wasting my time, bookseller.
Mayer: I’ve got this intuition about holy pictures.
Apollyon: Come in. Teresa been talking, eh?
Mayer: A little.
Apollyon: Are you a policeman?
Mayer: Are we talking about a police matter?
Apollyon: I didn’t do anything wrong, bookseller.
Mayer: Make up your mind. I’m either a bookseller or a policeman.
Apollyon: Whatever you are, I’ve got nothing to worry about.
Mayer: You could be very, very wrong there.
Apollyon: You’re fishing, aren’t you?
Mayer: And I intend to go on fishing until you tell me about the holy pictures.
Apollyon: On your bike.
Mayer: Mr Millhouse might not like your attitude when I mention it to him.
Apollyon: Mr Millhouse knows about it.
Mayer: But not all of it.
Apollyon: What do you mean?
Mayer: There’s something about the holy pictures that he doesn’t know. Something that would make him very cross. Something that might mean the end of Apollyon and his big, multicoloured dreams.
Apollyon: There are other people involved.
Mayer: People you’re scared of?
Apollyon: People I want to protect.
Mayer: Teresa, for instance?
Apollyon: Teresa can look after herself.
Mayer: In any way, she’s female. You’re gay, aren’t you, Maguire?
Apollyon: I’m proud of her.
Mayer: So who’s the special man or men you’re trying to protect?
Apollyon: No way, bookseller.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Walking through Glasgow as a foreign land, I suddenly saw myself as through a tourist’s eye and found I had become the weirdest paradox, a foreigner to myself. Who was this foreigner I’d allowed myself to become through vanity or eagerness to please, or perhaps both?
> 
> 
> In Sockey Hall Street, I caught a glimpse of myself in a shop window, my face, a stupid face. The face of a man who had gleefully agreed to whatever confidence trick had been worked upon him, an innocent abroad, a fish out of water. And I found myself longing for old, familiar territory, *nostalgie de la bookshop*.
> 
> But lacking that, I took myself back to the hotel and found Teresa seated in the lounge behind a pot of coffee.
> 

*[In the hotel lounge]*

Teresa: Are you as angry as you look?
Mayer: Angrier.
Teresa: Have some coffee.
Mayer: No, thank you.
Teresa: What made you angry?
Mayer: You and your whole stricken family.
Teresa: What have we done now?
Mayer: You’ve conned me.
Teresa: In what way?
Mayer: You’re all playing me off against each other.
Teresa: You’re not just looking for excuses.
Mayer: For what?
Teresa: Well, you’re no nearer finding Jock Cameron, are you?
Mayer: Maybe that was the whole object of the exercise.
Teresa: What? Not finding him, you mean?
Mayer: I’m beginning to think so.
Teresa: You’ve bitten off more than you can chew. That’s what you’re really saying, isn’t it?
Mayer: That’s possible.
Teresa: And now you want to pack it in?
Mayer: No.
Teresa: If you were as clever at solving mysteries as you are at dreaming them up–
Mayer: I’m not. And that perhaps is the whole point.
Teresa: I’m going to follow your example and give up.
Mayer: And I’m going to act like someone out of Chandler and Hammett and start asking very personal questions.
Teresa: My life is an open book.
Mayer: Let’s hope it’s written in a language we both understand.
Teresa: Amen to that.
Mayer: What do you remember about your parents?
Teresa: What have they got to do with anything?
Mayer: Why do you always answer a question with another one?
Teresa: Do I?
Mayer: There you are. You’ve done it again.
Teresa: Oh, sorry.
Mayer: Your parents?
Teresa: They were both killed in a car crash when I was one year old.
Mayer: So you don’t remember anything about them?
Teresa: Not very much.
Mayer: Did your grandfather ever talk about them?
Teresa: My grandfather was a very private person.
Mayer: That can be a cover-up for a commoner guard and selfishness.
Teresa: That’s not how I saw him.
Mayer: How exactly did you see him?
Teresa: As a victim.
Mayer: I wouldn’t have said that.
Teresa: Maybe we have different definitions of the word.
Mayer: Obviously we have.
Teresa: It’s a terrible thing to be a survivor, isn’t it?
Mayer: I suppose that depends on what you survive.
Teresa: Is it possible to survive something physically and be destroyed by it mentally?
Mayer: It happens all the time.
Teresa: Don’t patronize me.
Mayer: Don’t be touchy. Get on with what you’re saying.
Teresa: You saw my grandfather’s room, didn’t you?
Mayer: I did.
Teresa: That room says it all. The maps on the table, the posters on the wall, “Defensa Madre des Defensa Catalunya”. Some corner of a foreign field that is forever what?
Mayer: Fossilized.
Teresa: Right. Inside that room, he was still chief of staff of the 14th International Brigade. Outside it was a world he never really understood.
Mayer: Or perhaps understood only too well.
Teresa: I don’t think so.
Mayer: Tell me something.
Teresa: Yes?
Mayer: Jocelyn Coleman.
Teresa: Yuck.
Mayer: Was he in Spain with your grandfather?
Teresa: Yes.
Mayer: I’d like to ask you something else about Spain.
Teresa: Well, I’m sure you would, but I haven’t time. I must fly. Literally.
Mayer: You’re going back to London?
Teresa: I have a funeral to attend.
Mayer: It’s a silly thing to say in the circumstances, but, well, I’m glad you’re going to it.
Teresa: Tell you another silly thing. I feel really angry now because I can’t apologize to my grandfather for what I thought about him.
Mayer: Save your anger for Jocelyn.
Teresa: He’ll never know what hit him. By the way, do you know where the Third Eye Center is?
Mayer: Sounds like a trendy optician’s.
Teresa: You’ll find it’s not.
Mayer: What else will I find?
Teresa: Someone who wants to talk to you about holy pictures.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I don’t know what I expected the Third Eye Center to be. Men in orange robes, perhaps, exchanging with each other the sound of one hand clapping or some other subtlety of Zen. All of them looking like The Last Supper as visualized by Picasso. Instead, I walked into a bookshop, which became an art gallery, or if that didn’t turn you on, a health food restaurant.
> 
> 
> He was sitting in the restaurant, a strangely forlorn figure. He looked as though he’d been sitting there for some considerable time. And when he saw me, he smiled, an uneasy smile.
> 

*[In the restaurant in the Third Eye Center]*

Nuke: Hello, bookseller.
Mayer: Hello, Nuke.
Nuke: I’d almost given you up.
Mayer: I thought it would be Maguire, not his minder.
Nuke: “The Lord looketh not on outward appearance. He judges the soul.”
Mayer: Oh, old Zen proverb.
Nuke: Old Irish granny.
Mayer: What are you trying to say?
Nuke: I’m saying that looking like a thug doesn’t make me one.
Mayer: Holy pictures.
Nuke: Aye, the subject of my PhD thesis.
Mayer: I was hoping for something slightly less intellectual.
Nuke: And you shall have it.
Mayer: In your own time?
Nuke: How’s this for starters? I reckon Maguire’s a big talent.
Mayer: Millhouse might give you an argument there.
Nuke: To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, Millhouse knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.
Mayer: You’re not just an ugly face, are you?
Nuke: Spread the glad news.
Mayer: I will if you tell me about the holy pictures.
Nuke: I’m telling you about them.
Mayer: I thought you were getting sidetracked into a pop singer called Apollyon.
Nuke: Before he was Apollyon the would-be pop star, he was Terry Maguire, a bloody good painter.
Mayer: Ah.
Nuke: When we were living in the smoke, we went through a bad patch, and that’s when Maguire got into holy pictures.
Mayer: How’d he start?
Nuke: I suppose it was all down to Mrs Hurley.
Mayer: That name’s a holy picture in itself.
Nuke: She was a landlady, really ecumenical, you know, hated men, Catholic and Protestant. But we got on fine with her until the money ran out and we got behind with the rent.
Mayer: Then what?
Nuke: Well, I suppose looking back on it, she wasn’t such a bad old skin.
Mayer: She threw you out?
Nuke: No.
Mayer: I find your narrative style very trying, you.
Nuke: I’m doing you a favour, bookseller.
Mayer: Well, in case I don’t live to find out what it is.
Nuke: You’ll live.
Mayer: Go on.
Nuke: Anyway, there we were, facing a furious landlady with no penny between us, and her winding up her sleeves to beat the bejesus out of us. And then a miracle happened.
Mayer: A miracle in Kilburn? What next?
Nuke: The amazing thing about miracles, according to Chesterton, is that they sometimes happen.
Mayer: How did this one happen?
Nuke: Mrs Hurley was just teeing off the slaggers when she caught sight of one of Maguire’s paintings.
Mayer: A holy picture?
Nuke: Yeah. A Madonna and Child. Mrs Hurley loved it.
Mayer: Did she buy it?
Nuke: We traded it for a rent for us.
Mayer: Was it an original painting, or a copy?
Nuke: A copy.
Mayer: Was this a one-off thing?
Nuke: Well, it would have been, but for Mrs Hurley. She brought in every old Catholic biddy in Kilburn to see her Madonna, and then they all wanted one. Soon Maguire was working full-time, turning out Madonnas.
Mayer: The same one?
Nuke: Oh, no. Maguire rang the changes. The world’s filled with pictures of simpering women holding kids who look like Japanese wrestlers.
Mayer: So that was the story of the holy pictures?
Nuke: Not quite.
Mayer: Let’s have it all.
Nuke: Well, bookseller, one night Maguire and me were in this gay bar we used to go to. We get talking to one of the regulars, an older guy, and in the course of the conversation, the story of Mrs Hurley and the holy pictures cropped up. I was telling it as a big joke, but Maguire didn’t see it that way.
Mayer: Why not?
Nuke: Maguire’s a worrier, manic depressive. He’d discovered doing these holy pictures that he’d a talent for aping other painters’ styles, and that got him wondering if that was his real talent and know anything of his own. Then this bloke we were talking to came up with this suggestion.
Mayer: Which was?
Nuke: He said he had this collection of paintings, moderns mostly, which he’d been meaning to have copied for some time. Some of them to do with insurance, he said. You put the original in a bank vault and hang up the copy for your friends to drool over.
Mayer: Society ladies do the same sort of thing with their diamonds.
Nuke: I love to take your word for that. Anyway, Maguire agrees to give it a go, out of politeness or maybe pub talk, or maybe we thought he was some kind of nut. After all, you don’t take seriously a blind guy talking about pictures.
Mayer: This man was blind?
Nuke: Blind as a bat. So you can imagine your shock horror when he turns up the next night with the most beautiful Lowry I’ve ever seen.
Mayer: And Maguire copied it?
Nuke: Aye. The blind man—
Mayer: Let’s just call him Coleman.
Nuke: All right. Coleman tried it out on an expert and it fooled him.
Mayer: How many paintings did Maguire copy?
Nuke: Have you seen the gallery in Teresa’s house?
Mayer: I have.
Nuke: Pure Maguire.
Mayer: So that’s it.
Nuke: Oh, look now, whatever you think it is, bookseller, Terry copied pictures. End of story, right?

[In the hotel lounge]*

Teresa: Are you as angry as you look?
Mayer: Angrier.
Teresa: Have some coffee.
Mayer: No, thank you.
Teresa: What made you angry?
Mayer: You and your whole stricken family.
Teresa: What have we done now?

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Is there an aura that comes from policemen, private eyes, income tax inspectors, and those who are denigrated by sinners of various types? An aura that breeds silence and secrecy and sullenness and resentment. Silence, secrecy, sullenness, resentment, all evaporate and vanish, disappear, if you can persuade that aura to fade into nothing. The secret of life, I told myself, is not to want to know too much. It’s to settle for being a happy idiot. It’s to let great secrets seek you out and tell themselves to you, while Philip Marlowe wastes shoe leather walking down those mean streets. This train of thought carried me back to my hotel room.
> 

*[In the hotel room]
[Phone Ringing]*

Mayer: Hello?
Lovat: Is that Mr Mayer?
Mayer: Yes.
Lovat: Hello, Mr Mayer. My name is Lovat, Dr Lovat. I’m a friend of Agnes McLauchlan.
Mayer: Yes?
Lovat: Mr Mayer, are you still interested in Jock Cameron?
Mayer: I don’t know.
Lovat: Well, that’s a pretty dusty answer, Mayer.
Mayer: A reflection of my own confusion.
Lovat: Hmm. Why were you looking for Cameron?
Mayer: Somebody asked me to.
Lovat: And now that somebody is dead, and you’re wondering if that releases you from your obligation.
Mayer: That’s it in a nutshell.
Lovat: Perhaps that particular death released a lot of us from obligations.
Mayer: Shall I come and see you?
Lovat: I’ll send a car for you.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I stood in the hotel foyer while the minutes dripped past like raindrops, and I had a sense of something ended, or perhaps of something that had never really begun.
> 
> 
> And then suddenly, there was someone at my side, a small compact man with piercing blue eyes. He was wearing jeans and a brown suede jacket, and there was something ageless about his face. Something burned into it by sun and suffering. A timeless face that asked perpetually a timeless question.
> 
> Who built Thebes of the seven gates?
> 

*[In the hotel foyer]*

Cameron: Your name Mayer?
Mayer: Yes.
Cameron: Dr. Lovat sent me to pick you up. I’ve got the motor outside.
Mayer: What made you come out of hiding, Jock?
Cameron: I had a job to do.
Mayer: Mission accomplished.
Cameron: I don’t think you could say that.
Mayer: Could I say that about my own mission?
Cameron: We’ll talk about that in the motor.

*[In the car]*

Mayer: Are you sure this is your car?
Cameron: No fancy enough for you.
Mayer: Something tells me this car is hot.
Cameron: Well, open the bloody windies. Fasten your seat belt.
Mayer: You’ve heard that Forrest is dead?
Cameron: Bad news travels fast.
Mayer: And good men are scarce, right?
Cameron: He was something more than that. He was a great man.
Mayer: A great soldier isn’t necessarily a great human being.
Cameron: I’ll give you that. But Sandy Forrest was both.
Mayer: I think he was less than honest with me.
Cameron: That’s just another way of saying that he thought you could handle yourself no matter what happened.
Mayer: Very flattering. But I might have been more flattered if he confided in me more fully.
Cameron: I’ll tell you something.
Mayer: I’ll make a refreshing change.
Cameron: I didn’t know what you brought into this thing at all.
Mayer: I don’t even know what thing you’re talking about.
Cameron: Ask whatever you like. If the answer’s classified, well, I’ll classify it.
Mayer: You’re crazy with power.
Cameron: Aye, that’ll be right.
Mayer: Do you remember a poster from the last war? It said, “Is your journey really necessary?”
Cameron: I mind it fine.
Mayer: Was my journey up here really necessary?
Cameron: Where you getting that?
Mayer: I think that Forrest knew where you were all the time.
Cameron: Maybe he did.
Mayer: Then why the charade then?
Cameron: Need doot you’ll hear theory about that.
Mayer: You and Forrest made brilliant reputations in Spain, right?
Cameron: So I’ve heard.
Mayer: But when the Hitler War broke out, the army didn’t want to know you.
Cameron: Maybe we wore the wrong old school ties.
Mayer: Forrest was public school and university. His qualifications were impeccable.
Cameron: He was a premature anti-fascist.
Mayer: Now what the hell does that mean?
Cameron: It means bugger off. We don’t want to know you.
Mayer: Were you tied with the same brush?
Cameron: Everybody that fought against Franco was.
Mayer: Including the gay Mr Coleman.
Cameron: Coleman never fought against Franco.
Mayer: But he was in Spain during the Civil War.
Cameron: He was in the British Embassy in Madrid. He did us some small favours.
Mayer: Small is right.
Cameron: I don’t get that.
Mayer: Was one of the small favours helping to smuggle a child out of the country?
Cameron: Right.
Mayer: You’ve moved in influential circles in your time, Jock.
Cameron: True. Well, it was Forrest that fixed things up about the kid.
Mayer: And how did he manage that?
Cameron: Well, he and Coleman went to the same school. I think Coleman fancied him. Maybe that’s putting it mildly.
Mayer: What makes you say that?
Cameron: That kid cost Coleman his career. Somebody blabbed about it. Maybe even Coleman himself. Anyway, that was him kaput. He was sent home.
Mayer: Was it your child, Cameron?
Cameron: No. A lot of folk thought that. I’ve a feeling that Agnes McLoughlin maybe even believed it. But she was wrong. It happened exactly the way I’d tellt it. I found it in a shell hole.
Mayer: I believe you.
Cameron: I don’t give a bugger whether you believe me or no.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> We left the city behind and drove through smug, prosperous little towns, where every house had its own lawn and regimented roses. Some of them had ponds stocked with fish. Goldfish, of course. Not a garden gnome in sight. The only gnomes recognized by the people in these houses could not be persuaded to leave Zurich. Then the houses began to space themselves out, becoming further and further apart. Until finally, we came to one that stood absolutely on its own.
> 
> 
> A man was standing at the gate, staring down the road as though the isolation had suddenly become too much and had driven him out in search of company.
> 

*[In the car]
[Outside Dr. Lovat’s house]*

Cameron: End of the line.
Mayer: I still have some questions to ask you.
Cameron: Put them to Dr. Lovat.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> The car drove off, and Dr. Lovat watched it go, as though for a fleeting moment, he had suddenly recalled a shining dream of when the world was young and the clean air carried only songs of possibility.
> 
> 
> And for a moment, I felt a pang of bitter jealousy, a sense of being excluded from his memories, faith, innocence.I envied him as I followed him into the house.
> 

*[In Dr. Lovat’s house]*

Lovat: Please sit down. Well, Mayer, so you finally found Jock Cameron.
Mayer: Did I?
Lovat: Something bothering you?
Mayer: You made the mistake of making it all too easy.
Lovat: A strange objection, if I may say so.
Mayer: Oh, it was well done as far as it went. Old Henderson’s initial hostility and reluctance to talk, then his sudden change of heart. That leads me, or perhaps rather more accurately, manipulates me in the direction of Agnes McLauchlan and her romantic story.
Lovat: All true and verifiable.
Mayer: Granted, all good stuff. The path to Jock Cameron, intriguing and not too difficult, until a strange thing happens.
Lovat: And what was that?
Mayer: Cameron decides to surface of his own accord.
Lovat: In what way do you find that significant?
Mayer: I think that something happened to change my role in this whole affair, whatever that may have been.
Lovat: I’m in a bit of a dilemma here.
Mayer: In what way?
Lovat: I can’t say anything without saying too much.
Mayer: Does that matter anymore?
Lovat: You mean now that Sandy Forrest is dead?
Mayer: That’s exactly what I mean.
Lovat: I’m not going into details, but you are due some kind of explanation.
Mayer: Thank you.
Lovat: You’re quite right. The whole Jock business was a red herring.
Mayer: Why?
Lovat: We were using you as a decoy.
Mayer: Oh, great, especially since decoys are almost by definition expendable.
Lovat: You were never in any danger from Hanrahan.
Mayer: I seem to have heard that name somewhere before.
Lovat: I shouldn’t think so.
Mayer: What makes you say that?
Lovat: Hanrahan is a hitman, a very unusual hitman.
Mayer: What makes him unusual?
Lovat: He always worked for the partner, his daughter Nora.
Mayer: I’ve met them and lived to tell the tale.
Lovat: Hanrahan only kills those he’s paid to kill.
Mayer: He has a certain sense of humour anyway.
Lovat: I’ve never heard him accused of that.
Mayer: He went on about a mysterious character called Hanrahan.
Lovat: That sounds more like Norah’s style. They probably underrated you. People like the Hanrahans are prone to tunnel vision.
Mayer: I told them a yarn that was, well, not quite a lie, but a reinterpretation of the fact, so to speak.
Lovat: What were they pretending to be?
Mayer: A special branch.
Lovat: And what made you suspicious?
Mayer: They said they’d been checking out on me. Yet when I gave my bookshop a false name, they didn’t notice.
Lovat: Hmm. As I said, they underrated you.
Mayer: I’d hate you to make the same mistake, Dr. Lovat.
Lovat: How about this for a scenario?
Mayer: We have an organisation that is or is regarded as being a danger to the state.
Lovat: This is pure speculation, of course.
Mayer: Shall I speculate some more?
Lovat: Please do.
Mayer: Right. My hypothetical organisation has a problem, the kind of problem that seems almost endemic in the kind of organisation it is. Someone in the organisation or close to it has been passing on information.
Lovat: The technical term is mole.
Mayer: I was part of a scheme to unearth that mole.
Lovat: You may not have noticed it, Mayer, but you’ve suddenly stopped being hypothetical.
Mayer: Maybe the time has passed for hypotheses.
Lovat: Maybe. Well, it’s been an interesting conversation.
Mayer: One last thing which perhaps you know nothing about.
Lovat: What’s that?
Mayer: The business about the paintings.
Lovat: Oh, nothing mysterious or sinister there. Forrest needed money, so he sold them off.
Mayer: Why copies then?
Lovat: Because he liked them, but not in the kind of way that comes of exclusive ownership.
Mayer: I got the impression that he was quite well-heeled.
Lovat: Oh, he was. He was. But even the well-heeled have temporary difficulties.
Mayer: Yes?
Lovat: Well, I first came across Sandy Forrest in Spain. I was with an ambulance unit and had some ridiculous ambition to become a doctor, but my background was respectable poverty and this was before the days of university grants. After Spain, Forrest financed me through university. It was Sandy Forrest who paid Henderson’s bills in the nursing home. It was Sandy Forrest who kept Agnes McLauchlan afloat after her father died. God knows how many more he helped, for he never talked about it.
Mayer: What do you intend to do about the mole?
Lovat: I intend not to say another word on that subject.
Mayer: How do I get back to the hotel?
Lovat: Jock will take you back when he returns.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Ten weary minutes passed before Jock returned and drove me back through the smug little towns and their houses with their manicured lawns and their regimented shrubs and flowers. A small, polite rain had begun to fall and Jock drove through it in a silence that had begun to become oppressive and excluding and irritating enough to provoke a counter reaction in me.
> 

*[In the car]*

Mayer: Were you ever in a Trappist monastery?
Cameron: Once.
Mayer: In Spain?
Cameron: Where else?
Mayer: How long did you spend in it?
Cameron: Just as long as it took to kill a sniper.
Mayer: Do you like cars, Jock?
Cameron: I can take them or leave them.
Mayer: This is one you preferred to take, isn’t it?
Cameron: Is that right?
Mayer: Last time I was in this car was with Hanrahan and Norah.
Cameron: Then you were in bad company.
Mayer: Yeah. I wonder what became of them.
Cameron: I wonder.
Mayer: Maybe they were terminated with extreme prejudice. Is that the phrase?
Cameron: That’s the phrase.
Mayer: What exactly does it mean?
Cameron: It means they weren’t as bloody clever as they thought.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Back at the hotel, I looked out of my window at Glasgow for the last time. It said nothing to me, nor I to it. We had not sought each other’s acquaintance, nor had there been any love at first sight. All that we had to say to each other had been said. It was the same day, but in a different country and at a different time. I had a sense of having come full circle.

> 
> The bookshop smelled the same, the same aroma of other people’s thoughts. And as I stood there savouring it, I was aware that someone had come into the shop. And I turned to meet the mocking smile of a man I knew, a blind man whose name was Jocelyn Coleman.

*[In the bookshop]*

Coleman: Glad to be back in London, Mayer.
Mayer: Yes.
Coleman: Won’t you ask me to sit down?
Mayer: All right. Over here.
Coleman: Ah. Thank you. So, you found Jock Cameron.
Mayer: I did rather more than that, Coleman.
Coleman: Really?
Mayer: I’m afraid I blew your cover.
Coleman: I don’t think so, dear boy.
Mayer: Oh, no?
Coleman: No, it’s a long story.
Mayer: Does it begin with a child being smuggled out of Spain, say, 50 years ago?
Coleman: Who told you that?
Mayer: Jock Cameron. He said the incident cost you your career.
Coleman: What else did he say?
Mayer: He said you were in love with Forrest, and you had been ever since your school days.
Coleman: Jock is an unreconstructed romantic.
Mayer: You, on the other hand, are not, nor have you ever been.
Coleman: No, I have a terrible feeling you’re working up to something nasty.
Mayer: Suppose Cameron was wrong. Suppose your masters offered you a deal.
Coleman: What a lively imagination you have, dear boy.
Mayer: It gets livelier.
Coleman: Do go on.
Mayer: The deal was that they’d forget all about your breach of regulations on one condition.
Coleman: That condition being that I spied on Forrest and his friends.
Mayer: You admit it?
Coleman: Cheerfully.
Mayer: Where I come from, that’s treachery. What kind of information were you passing on?
Coleman: Oh, rubbish mostly. No better than gossip. Matahari I was not.
Mayer: Yet you kept on with it after Spain.
Coleman: Hmm. Maybe treachery is habit forming.
Mayer: You make it sound very boring.
Coleman: Very boring it is, dear boy. Except for one thing.
Mayer: What was that?
Coleman: I told Forrest.
Mayer: I find that very difficult to believe.
Coleman: Then you are denying the existence of any kind of love that isn’t heterosexual.
Mayer: So you were a mole after all.
Mayer: Absolutely. It just happened that you, dear boy, were looking in the wrong mole hill.
Mayer: What was Forrest’s reaction when you told him?
Coleman: He thought it was a huge joke.
Mayer: A long time to keep a joke going, I would have thought.
Mayer: He used to tell me about an old aunt of his who would never throw anything out. She had a stock reply for anyone who tried to persuade her to get rid of years of accumulated rubbish. Keep a thing for seven years, she’d say, and it’s bound to come in handy.
Mayer: And is that what happened?
Mayer: Yes. What I’m trying to say is that because he made his reputation in Spain, people tend to forget that Forrest was a Scot. But he was, very much so. He had strong views about North Sea oil and the dumping of nuclear waste, things like that. And NATO, of course. His native land, he used to declare was being reduced to the status of Fortress Scotland.
Mayer: So he set up a freedom movement?
Coleman: No.
Mayer: But you said?
Coleman: He set up two freedom movements.
Mayer: You’re not serious?
Coleman: I swear to you that I am. Nowadays, I think the technical term is disinformation. The whole purpose of the Harry Lauder team, as Forrest always referred to us, was to distract attention away from the A-team who were getting on with the real job. Don’t ask me who they are, because I don’t know. Forrest kept that information close to his chest.
Mayer: Who were the Harry Lauder team?
Coleman: Forrest, Dr. Lovat, Jock Cameron, and myself. Though MI5 didn’t know that, of course.
Mayer: What kind of things did you do?
Coleman: It wasn’t so much that we actually did anything. It was the atmosphere we created. Our briefing was, in Forrest’s words, “to create and maintain a high profile of comic ineptitude.” Like the assassination that never happened, because at the critical moment, the assassin was seized with a violent bout of diarrhea. Or there was the occasion when one of the gangs stored dynamite in a village hall without telling anyone else about it. Unfortunately, he stored it inside the old-fashioned stove.
Mayer: Surely MI5 must have realized they were being sent out.
Coleman: Oh, paranoia has no sense of humor.
Mayer: So who was supposed to be supplying you with all this disinformation from your phone organization?
Coleman: Dr. Lovat. He was my disgruntled source as far as MI5 were concerned. Cameron was Metro Man. Forrest was the bumbling idealist who picked up all the tabs. Did I ever tell you about the paintings?
Mayer: You never told me anything. All you did was utter dire warnings about Jock Cameron.
Coleman: Part of the general mystification. If I remember correctly, at the time, you said that you had not yet made up your mind to become involved.
Mayer: The paintings. You sold them, didn’t you?
Coleman: I sold the copies. MI5 is filled with people who are now the proud owners of bogus Lowry’s, bogus Wallace’s, or whatever.
Mayer: What a superlative con man you are, Coleman.
Coleman: Oh, what a thing to say to a poor blind man.
Mayer: So what happened to the Harry Lauder outfit?
Coleman: The Americans happened to it. Ever since NATO, we’ve had to cooperate with the Americans on all matters that might concern that organization. Copies of every memo to whatever actors happen to be inhabiting the White House at the moment. MI5 don’t particularly like it, but they go along with it. That’s how the CIA eventually became aware of the Harry Lauder outfit. And being the kind of gung-ho chaps they are, you can probably guess how they reacted.
Mayer: Well, MI5 saw a bunch of jokers. They saw a subversive organization.
Coleman: Right. Then I heard a rumor that they were in contact with a Hanrahan.
Mayer: The CIA brought in the hit team.
Coleman: That’s the way they operate. MI5 folklore has it that they’ve been responsible for the death of one Scottish nationalist already. His murder remains unsolved to this day.
Mayer: And you made the reasonable assumption that the Harry Lauder outfit was next on the list.
Coleman: A logical deduction, insofar as logic ever enters into these things. Forrest was a great believer in getting his retaliation in first. So we concocted a fiction for MI5. The Harry Lauder outfit was being torn apart by internal dissension. Its leader was a very sick man. God knows that was truer than we realized. And had lost all control. Lovat wanted to get out. Cameron had gone berserk and was making all kinds of wild threats against all things American. Forrest was worried sick, especially since he didn’t exactly know where Cameron was. All very touching. Not a dry seat in the house.
Mayer: So I was sent to find the berserk Cameron.
Coleman: That was the story.
Mayer: But why me?
Coleman: Because your grandfather was Cameron’s great buddy in Spain. He gave the story a final ring of authenticity.
Mayer: You’re not telling me the truth even yet, Coleman.
Coleman: Oh, what a terribly wounding remark.
Mayer: I know I was a decoy. You wanted me to provoke the Americans into making a move.
Coleman: I had hoped to spare you that realization.
Mayer: It worked, didn’t it?
Coleman: Like a charm, if I may coin a phrase.
Mayer: Was Theresa involved in the plot?
Coleman: No. She ran errands for us, nothing more.
Mayer: You realize, of course, that the Americans won’t leave it at this.
Coleman: Oh, it doesn’t seem to matter much anymore.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> The place was crowded for the final act. The audience or congregation or whatever is the word for those who attend a cremation consisted mostly of old men. They wore shiny blue serge suits and black ties. And they spoke in whispers as though anything louder would disturb the dead man they had gathered to honor. Some of them lacked an arm, some a leg. None of them lacked a kind of pride.
> 
> 
> Then the shoulders straightened and the head snapped back as Jock Cameron was suddenly there standing in front of the coffin.

*[In the crematorium]*

Cameron: Comrades, a lot of you are bound to remember Captain George Nathan. You’ll recall the riding boots he wore that shone like the Spanish sun and his wee swagger stick with a gold knob. We used to think he was immortal, that the wee swagger stick with something magic, for he was eyeing the thick of the action, yet he seemed to bear a charmed life. But the magic ran out at Brunetti. And as George Nathan lay dying, he asked us to sing him out of life, which we did. Comrades of the International Brigade, we owe nae less to Sandy Forrest, a great soldier and a loyal comrade. So I ask you to be upstanding and Jock end the song without me telling you.

*[People sing]*

🎵 There’s a valley in Spain called Jalama.
🎵 That’s a place that we all know so well.
🎵 For it is here that we wasted our manhood and most of our old age as well.
🎵 From this valley they tell us we’re leaving, but don’t hasten to bid us adieu.
🎵 For even though we make our departure, we’ll be back in an hour or two.
🎵 Oh, we’re proud of our Lincoln Battalion and the marathon record it’s made.
🎵 Please do us this little favor and take this last word to Brigade.
🎵 You’ll never be happy with strangers.
🎵 They would not understand you as we.
🎵 So remember the Jalama Valley and the old men who wait patiently.

*[The end]*
