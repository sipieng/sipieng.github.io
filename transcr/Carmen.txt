[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The Tyrone reveal of beautiful death awaits us both, my ferocious one.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Skin of my skin, heart of my heart.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The cards have told me that today they have come to witness your bleeding flesh,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
your blood and sand, and that they will soon witness my own.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Easy.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Shh.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We shall not be afraid.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We must have pity on them, for they cannot contain such beasts as us.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And what can't be tamed must be killed.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Ah, see how he sparkles and glints in the sun.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
When the blade cuts into our flesh, we will not look to escape the pain, but go to it.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Become its master.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let the killer tempt, tease and fill our bodies with flames.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We both know behind his cloak lies the exquisite abyss.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Wear your death with pride, just as I shall wear mine.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now perhaps we shall both be free.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Liar!

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's true!

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
O'Connor! O'Connor! O'Connor!

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's what he says!

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't I hear him again and I...

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, it's him!

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I swear to you I'll never need him again, I swear to you.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
O'Connor!

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Guards!

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Guards!

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You are beautiful no more.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Mother!

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I confess her, I confess her, I am killed!

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Go to her, you Spanish slut!

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Guard, grab that woman and watch out, she has a knife!

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Come any closer and I'll kill you all!

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let go of me!

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm dying, I tell you!

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Neo, she's cut her brow and an X on your cheek.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm ruined!

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The world is not mortal, though it's near here.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let me help you.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Put my coat under your head.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Scars for life? How am I to earn a living now?

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Beg for it like a dog!

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This woman needs a doctor and as for you...

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't you dare touch me!

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Where are you taking me?

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The guardhouse!

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But, senor official, sir, please have pity on me.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So now it's sir? A moment ago you wanted to kill me.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're so young, so good looking.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let me get away and I'll give you a little barlatchie that will make every woman fall in love with you.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I need no magic powders or potions.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Arrogant pig!

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Damned alley cat!

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Your face, sir.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
She's drunk blood with those claws.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I curse you and your family.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Get her out of here!

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
May your mother die of the pox and your wife and children, may they suffer and starve in poverty.

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What is that song?

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And that language?

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Your accent?

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It disturbs you.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, you are playing l'hombre?

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't play anything.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But those cards?

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's not a game.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You belong to Córdoba?

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I belong nowhere.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
At all events, Andalusian?

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can't guess what I am.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Perhaps of Moorish blood. A Jewess?

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Did you never hear tell of Carmenchita?

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The gypsy?

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The men in the garrison speak of you.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Then those cards are...

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Well?

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Standing so close to a sorceress should make you recoil in horror.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And yet you could reach out and touch me.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have never seen you before.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I've just lately arrived.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Seville can be a lonely place.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You belong to our Basque country.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Elizondo.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And I from Etxalar.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Not far I was journeyed from your home.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're Basque?

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Our language is so beautiful, sir,

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
that even hearing the accent in a foreign land makes us quiver.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Conrad of my heart, what is your name?

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don José.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don José.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I wish I had a confessor from my own country.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Tell me what happened to you.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What brought you here?

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I was carried off to Seville by gypsies.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I've been working to earn enough money to take me back to Navarre.

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
To my poor old mother,

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
who has no support in the world but me.

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If I were only back in my own country,

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
looking up at the White Mountains.

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And tonight in the bar?

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That woman insulted our country.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I told her one Basque man was worth ten of her Seville boasters.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You could have killed her.

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
She deserved to die.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But I'm sorry I scratched your face.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What are you doing?

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
At the corner of your mouth, a speck of blood.

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let me wipe it away.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's OK, I...

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You shiver at my touch.

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Do I frighten you?

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I frighten myself.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm a woman in a cage, what harm can I do?

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There.

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A good, clean soldier again.

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I will wear your blood in my hair tonight.

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Do I shock you?

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The flowers in your hair.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Jasmine.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The perfume's intoxicating.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Would you like to pick one from the bunch?

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Go on.

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I won't bite.

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why do you look at me that way?

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There's something strange and wild about your beauty.

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You think me an animal.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Feline.

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Lying in wait for a sparrow.

137
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh, you think me a bird.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A fly.

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So now my cat is a spider?

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Am I already yours?

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're the tip of the tongue.

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Your watch plays music.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's midnight.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In a few hours I'll be taken to prison and we'll never see you again.

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There's nothing I can do for you.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Pretty chain.

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That watch is gold.

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It was my father's.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don Jose, there may be nothing you can do for me, but perhaps...

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Perhaps there is something I can do for you.

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Here, on this bed.

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Such as?

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Come closer.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Closer?

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The distance between us is too great for what I have in mind.

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You wish me to enter your cell.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I see no alternative, Bayeux.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But that's against the...

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The rules.

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes.

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And you always play by them, don't you?

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You like making fun of me.

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I like making lots of things.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't think I'm... I'm not sure I...

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Very well.

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If you force me to reveal my hand...

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Cards.

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let me tell your dukkah a bit.

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
My...

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Fortune.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I should play games with a servant of the devil.

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Your cards have already been dealt.

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Come.

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sit across from me.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You have silver?

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You would even make your jailor pay.

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Especially my jailor.

178
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I carry no money.

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Then you are already in my debt.

180
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The ace of cups.

181
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Which means?

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Everything starts with love.

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You see on the card, the open hand which holds the cup?

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I see it.

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This reveals the initial flow of emotion

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that becomes a raging river if you will only give it time and attention.

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah, how can...

188
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Love is divinely blessed, senor.

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
A flame that ignites the blaze of passion.

190
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But beware.

191
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It can also consume and destroy.

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The wheel of fortune.

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Well?

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You see how the wheel hovers in the clouds?

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This shows you can try to reach it but never fully understand it.

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Then there's the sphinx on the top.

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Typhon the snake on the left and...

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't know these symbols.

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's the wheel of destiny and fate and yours is turning.

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Struggle against the wheel and it will crush you.

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What is it?

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Go on.

203
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The fool.

204
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He has the innocence of a child but also perfect trust and fearlessness.

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And what does it say?

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That you are going on a journey.

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But all journeys imply risk,

208
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
hence the fool is pictured walking towards the edge of a high cliff.

209
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He seems quite happy about it.

210
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The fool has no qualms about taking chances.

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He throws himself into the abyss,

212
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
knowing that although he may eventually fall,

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
for a while he will soar.

214
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
As will you.

215
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So I am the fool?

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Compadre, you must help your countrywoman tonight.

217
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't see how.

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If I were to give you a little push and you tumbled down,

219
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I could take your keys, unlock my cell door and make a dash across the yard.

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Those two Castilian recruits at the gate wouldn't be able to keep me back.

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It would mean court martial for me.

222
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You are far too clever and wise to let that happen.

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Besides, think how grateful I would be.

224
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Carmen, what did that last card really mean?

225
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
All that I said.

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It carried a warning for me.

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If a gypsy, even a woman stolen by them,

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
gives her heart to a Gorgia,

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
she is fated to die at his hands.

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This doesn't frighten you?

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
When my body burns, not even the fear of death can douse the flames.

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, then.

233
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Girl of my country,

234
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
may our Lady of the Mountain help you,

235
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and may God help me.

236
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Over there!

237
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There, in the lane.

238
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
She's too far ahead.

239
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
She runs like the wind. I'll get my horse, sir.

240
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No. We should be able to catch her on foot.

241
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How did she escape? She was under lock and key, was she not?

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There's no time for that now. We'll have to head her off.

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll go for the lane while you take the ridge.

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If we can't find her, we'll meet back here in an hour.

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What time is it now, sir?

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
On my watch, it's... it's gone.

247
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Almost dawn.

248
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No fires burning in the camp for me.

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hey, mongrel!

250
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You missed me.

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm glad someone did.

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Carmen, where have you been?

253
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We thought... we heard you'd killed someone.

254
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Gossip and lies.

255
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That you cut her throat. A scratch.

256
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And we're taken to prison. As you can see.

257
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Have you been under guard?

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Under a guard, more like.

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Garcia, cackle, you'll wake the camp.

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You don't think they're already listening?

261
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Let's gel in the wagon.

262
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
How do you manage your escape? Not here.

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You've something to hide. Not from you, but...

264
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But what?

265
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Are you sure you want the whole camp to know?

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sure they can guess.

267
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Shall I paint them a picture?

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Shall I slap you in the mouth?

269
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Kick you like a dog? Garcia, no.

270
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
A real woman would beg for my forgiveness.

271
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Then go find her!

272
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
One day, I will take your body in these hands...

273
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and break it into tiny pieces!

274
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Why, Carmen? Why must you taunt him?

275
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Do you like him angry? Is that it?

276
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Why do you always take his side?

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That is not true.

278
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No. No, it's not.

279
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Excitement. Always excitement with you.

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Not excitement.

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Then what?

282
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Mariah, there is such a fire of freedom in me,

283
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and sometimes I want to burn up everything and everyone.

284
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Even myself.

285
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But why?

286
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I might ask why it doesn't burn as fiercely in you.

287
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Or in anyone else.

288
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There is fire in us all, but we must control it.

289
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Why?

290
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Because we're women.

291
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And what of the men?

292
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You'll have to ask them.

293
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You can sleep with me tonight.

294
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Or what's left of it.

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll sleep under the wagon.

296
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
With Mungerall?

297
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He'll be better company.

298
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Me?

299
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Garcia.

300
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll only keep you awake.

301
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And I'll give Garcia a chance to calm down.

302
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There's something else.

303
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Go on.

304
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If Garcia finds out the fight in the bar last night was about Lucas,

305
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
he'll kill you both.

306
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He won't find out.

307
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You're sure?

308
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I am sure.

309
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
After all, who would dare tell him?

310
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Smells good.

311
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Uh, it's not for you.

312
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
If not for me, then who?

313
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Lila's pasty-er.

314
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That pig. He can't bake his own bread.

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We owe him something for hiding you the last time the Coast Guard were on your trail.

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And anyway, he likes my cooking.

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He likes looking at your rump while you serve it.

318
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That too.

319
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll cook you some scandals, Lila.

320
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Listening at the flap again?

321
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No, I...

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
At least she knows her place.

323
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Her place is not cooking for my husband.

324
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I just meant...

325
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I know what you meant, Maria.

326
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll go fetch some water.

327
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Shouldn't the goods be here by now?

328
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Maybe they've been held up by bandits.

329
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
All the same, I'd better gel a coy and see.

330
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I may be gone a few days.

331
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Try to stir all of prison.

332
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Try not to get killed.

333
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Carmen!

334
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh, my poor compadre, stuck in prison.

335
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Are you angry with me?

336
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Huh, wouldn't do any good.

337
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You see I did not steal your watch.

338
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You want it back?

339
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Keep it until I get out.

340
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
A month of staring through a barred window.

341
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
At least I can see people passing the street.

342
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Lots of pretty girls.

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You like silk stockings?

344
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Very much.

345
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You like mine?

346
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Even though I am so poor, they are filled with holes as you can see.

347
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If I lift my dress a little more, you'll see the snares go all the way up to...

348
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Carmen!

349
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If there are such things as witches, then you are certainly one.

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I have something for you.

351
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What now?

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You will see.

353
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Look here, you have a present.

354
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
A present?

355
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
From your cousin in Alcala de los Paraderos.

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But I have no cousin in...

357
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What is it?

358
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
An Alcala loaf.

359
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Such a delicious smell.

360
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What did this...my cousin look like?

361
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
She hasn't been here so long since I've seen her.

362
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Her face? I don't know.

363
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
She had a mantilla pulled across it.

364
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But the rest of her...

365
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Ay-ay-ay.

366
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It can't be.

367
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Surely...

368
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
At least you made it back with the goods.

369
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We were fortunate to get out of the gorge with even half the coffers.

370
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sure you'll be able to play tonight.

371
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's my uncle that's twisted.

372
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
My hands are fine.

373
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But the troops are closing in.

374
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,000
We'll need to keep an even closer look out at the camp from now on.

375
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Reporting for duty, sir.

376
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You don't have to call me sir out of a shot of the lieutenant.

377
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Thanks.

378
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He wants you to guard the door, make sure there's no trouble.

379
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Of course.

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You'll have to work ten times as hard to get yourself back in the lieutenant's good graces.

381
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I know that, Rodrigo.

382
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But I think you can do it.

383
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're not the first corporal to lose his stripes over a pretty girl.

384
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Aga Laguna?

385
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You!

386
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Good evening, compadre.

387
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You look...

388
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You approve?

389
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Breathtaking.

390
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But what are you doing here?

391
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We're often invited to dance and play at private or military houses.

392
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And when the lights go down, for other purposes...

393
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What if they recognize you?

394
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
They are too stupid to tell one gypsy from another.

395
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You brought the maracas?

396
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And the tambourines.

397
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This is Garcia and Mariah, my musicians.

398
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Where are we to go, senor?

399
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The party is assembled in the patio.

400
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Gracias.

401
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We'll talk later.

402
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You know that man?

403
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He was a corporal of the guard.

404
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's not what I meant.

405
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Carmen, where shall you sing?

406
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
On this table, I think.

407
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Where everyone can see.

408
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Beware Rosita, the brash señorita

409
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
One with the dark flashing eyes and the silky white dress

410
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Your poor heart, you'll break it

411
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Your wallet, you'll take it

412
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
She'll look in your eyes and confess it was done for a bet

413
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
She'll promise to love you, caress you and hug you

414
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Swear that she'll always be honest and faithful and true

415
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Soon as the night falls, freedom and fun comes

416
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Beware Rosita, the brash señorita

417
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We'll love you no more

418
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Isn't she extraordinary?

419
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes, extraordinary.

420
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Did you see her leap onto the table?

421
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Have you ever seen such a woman?

422
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No, Rodrigo.

423
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Unless you're a half.

424
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Something wrong?

425
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I would like to drive my sword through every man out here

426
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You're an idiot, which is why you didn't use the gifts I sent you in prison.

427
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I used the file to sharpen my lance, but I'll return this to you.

428
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You kept the money. We'll spend it together.

429
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Meet me tonight at the Triana, the past year place on the Calle de Candalejo.

430
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But, I'm not sure I...

431
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
[applause]

432
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Here, a sugar plum.

433
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, thank you.

434
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Must you stuff yourself like a six year old?

435
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Why are you putting the plums in the water jar?

436
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
To make sure that for Laila's past year, the owner.

437
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
No, don't throw the...

438
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That'll keep the flies from bothering us.

439
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If this past year sees you throwing away his dishes...

440
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He's been well paid to leave us alone tonight.

441
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Are you still sulking because I danced for the soldiers?

442
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You didn't just dance. I mean, did you have to be such a...

443
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
No, I didn't have to be. I like it.

444
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Sometimes. You act no better than a...

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Why must you talk me so?

446
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Because you are such a simpleton.

447
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Think no more of Carmen, cheater, or she'll become the gallows you are hanged upon.

448
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's too late for that.

449
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Then, let me dance for you.

450
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Alone. Here. Now.

451
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You have no castanets.

452
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Dance with me.

453
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Is there no prank or wild mischief you don't indulge in?

454
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You are my rum, I am your rummy.

455
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And I kneel before you.

456
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Carmen...

457
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I... I must get back to quarters.

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Back to quarters?

459
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
For roll call.

460
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Are you a slave? Or a canary bird?

461
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Your yellow dragoon dress suits you.

462
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You're the heart of a chicken.

463
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You'd have me in the guardhouse again.

464
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You don't think I'm worth it?

465
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Carmen...

466
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Please, just get up from there.

467
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
No.

468
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
If you want me, you'll have to get down on your dirt.

469
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The cards again?

470
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
A dark shadow follows me.

471
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The guard has been asking for you around town.

472
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This is not new.

473
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The one who let you escape from prison?

474
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The one at the party who looked at you with such...

475
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Such what?

476
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Carmen, you're playing a very dangerous game.

477
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Why do you do these things? Can't you just make Garcia happy?

478
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You have a good man. He...

479
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We need to gel these goods into Seville tonight.

480
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The whisky, tobacco and fabrics fetch a fair price.

481
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Once they're in town, Santos can put them on the market.

482
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
There'll be a sentry posted at the gates.

483
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
No one who can't be bribed.

484
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Word is, tonight it's the guard from the party.

485
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Careful, Maria. That's good whisky.

486
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This guard is a principled one, I think, trying to win back his stripes.

487
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
We may need some other kind of distraction.

488
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Garcia, I'm sure I could...

489
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Carmen!

490
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You want me to dance for him right there by the gates

491
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
while the rest of you climb over the wall?

492
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
How you distract him is up to you.

493
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
(GUN COCKS)

494
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Who's there? Nobody can pass here.

495
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Now, don't be spiteful, official meal.

496
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Carmen!

497
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Where have you been? Do you realise...

498
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Shh!

499
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
We have little time, so let our words be wise ones.

500
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Some people will be coming with bundles. Let them alone.

501
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I must not allow them through. These are my orders.

502
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You didn't think about orders at the Triana.

503
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That was two weeks ago. And where have you been since then?

504
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I've been able to think of nothing else but you.

505
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'll tell you later, but now you must let us through.

506
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
No. Not this time. I can't.

507
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Very well. I know to whom I can go.

508
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll ask your lieutenant to come with me to the Triana.

509
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He is handsome and good-natured,

510
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and he'll post a sentry who'll only see what he'd better see.

511
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Carmen, please!

512
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Wait!

513
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Are you sure we can trust him?

514
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He has allowed us this far.

515
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
If we are caught, it's the rope for us all.

516
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The path is clear.

517
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And what if a patrol should come?

518
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I warn you with my castanets.

519
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Let's hope you're not left dancing on our graves.

520
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Come back to bed.

521
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
What's wrong?

522
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You got what you wanted, didn't you?

523
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
They got through with the goods and no-one came.

524
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I don't like people who have to be pressed.

525
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It was my duty. It's my livelihood.

526
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I've already been demoted.

527
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I don't know why I've come here with you.

528
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Why did you not use what I sent you in prison to escape?

529
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I still have a soldier's code of honour.

530
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
To my people, liberty is everything.

531
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We burned down a town to save one day in prison.

532
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I thought you said you were not gypsy, that you were stolen by them.

533
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I care nothing for you any more.

534
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Oh, you never have.

535
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And yet I have risked everything for you.

536
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Here's a duro for your trouble.

537
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Romany will always pay their debt.

538
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I do not want your smugglers' money.

539
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Have it back!

540
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Garcia, what's going on?

541
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
There's to be a raid in the town tonight.

542
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
They mean to arrest every gypsy in the place and then come looking for us.

543
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
All of us?

544
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Go and find your guard and see if he'll fight with us.

545
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But...

546
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
We need all the help we can get.

547
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Where are you hiding, canary bird?

548
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
There's nowhere I haven't already looked.

549
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Except...

550
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
(SNIFFS)

551
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
A dragoon in tears?

552
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Your temper is like the weather in the mountains of our country.

553
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The storm is never so close as when the sun is at its brightest.

554
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Don José.

555
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Lieutenant.

556
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You must come at once.

557
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
We are about to begin a raid on the town to rid the place of gypsies.

558
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Grab her, she's one of them!

559
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
No! Don't you!

560
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Take your hands off her!

561
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Don't be a fool, she's a gypsy harlot.

562
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You would dare pull a sword on me?

563
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I want you to get off her!

564
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Cut!

565
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Great stupid canary bird!

566
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
He's dead.

567
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Lieutenant, we just found...

568
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Lieutenant?

569
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Murder! Murder! The lieutenant's been murdered!

570
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Quick, we must go!

571
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We're nearly way out of time.

572
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Your forehead.

573
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You're covered in blood.

574
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Let me roll this handkerchief around it.

575
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What have I done?

576
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You certainly can't stay here in town.

577
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
If you're caught, you'll be shot.

578
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So what now?

579
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Well, you're good with a sword.

580
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Why not turn smuggler?

581
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Become an outlaw?

582
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Haven't I promised to get you hanged?

583
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You bandaged my head only to break my neck.

584
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's better than being shot.

585
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And besides, if you set about it properly,

586
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
you'll live like a prince till the coast guard lay their hands on you.

587
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
There.

588
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
All done.

589
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You really mean,

590
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
going back to your camp, with you?

591
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
There is nothing in the world like making love while the stars explode in the sky.

592
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
The guards are getting closer.

593
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Let's go.

594
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:49,000
[MUSIC]

595
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
See to the horses, Juanito.

596
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You should not have brought that soldier here.

597
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The siege of the Cabra means half of our comrades have been scattered.

598
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
We are enough.

599
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
He's murdered one of his own, and they'll be on the lookout.

600
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
He'll have the whole garrison down on us.

601
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
He's good with his sword.

602
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What else?

603
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The Tudor, I'll tell you.

604
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I warn you, Carmenchita.

605
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
No, I warn you, Garcia.

606
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm tired of your threats.

607
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm sick of watching your dirty clothes.

608
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And your body, it bores me.

609
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
From now on, go to your whores in town,

610
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
or to Maria, who will wag her tail and beg for you.

611
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You!

612
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You dare to strike your husband!

613
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
If I had a knife in my hand, I would do more than that.

614
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Did you see what...

615
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I saw nothing, Don Jose.

616
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But he struck her!

617
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
No! You must not stand between man and wife.

618
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Man and... you mean...

619
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
She did not tell you?

620
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
No.

621
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
She did not.

622
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You and she... are you...

623
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
No. I just... don't like seeing a man strike a woman.

624
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Why not?

625
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Well, because... you think it just.

626
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
See this scar?

627
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Must be three inches long.

628
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
From my late husband, who was shot in a raid.

629
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
If you were to live among us, you must know how we live.

630
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
A gypsy woman cannot pass in front of a man,

631
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
or walk between two men.

632
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
She must go behind, or say "Bolde tutkakel".

633
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It means "Please turn away".

634
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
One day I forgot this.

635
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And that's why he hit you?

636
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I wear the scar with pride.

637
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Surely you...

638
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Women can be fickle, and need beating now and then.

639
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It proves her man is strong, and can take care of her.

640
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It shows love.

641
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And who would not choose blood over indifference?

642
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Carmen doesn't seem to live by your rules.

643
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
A word of advice, senor.

644
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
If you care for Carmen, leave her alone.

645
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Leaving us so soon?

646
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
To go where?

647
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Anywhere.

648
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You are wanted for murder. Your choices are few.

649
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Why did you not tell me about your... that you were...

650
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Would you have come back to the camp if I had?

651
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You expect me to stay while you... while you and he...

652
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You disgust me.

653
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Get down!

654
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Dragoons!

655
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
There's perhaps a dozen or more.

656
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
We don't want ammunition.

657
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Orlando, pack up the charging covers.

658
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And don't forget the cotton stocking.

659
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Let's get out of here.

660
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Carmen, you ride with me.

661
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, compadre, looks like you're one of us, whether you like it or not.

662
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Hyah!

663
00:29:44,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I think I lost them.

664
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I think you lost us.

665
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
At least we made it out alive.

666
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We'll leave our horses here and go to the gorge on foot.

667
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
If they are still behind, they'll never follow us down here.

668
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We'll carry what we can and hide the rest.

669
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
This is my life from now on.

670
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You'll get used to it.

671
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You really think I'll prefer a smuggler's life to a soldier's?

672
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You'll have money.

673
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I want you.

674
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Then having money will help your cause.

675
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Just come away with me.

676
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
After all, I am in this because of you.

677
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You sent your lieutenant to his grave, not I.

678
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You betrayed me. He said nothing of your husband.

679
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You would have come anyway.

680
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Am I such a fool to want to bind us together?

681
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Garcia would find us.

682
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
In South America?

683
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
He would find us in hell.

684
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But...

685
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You must never admit we are lovers to anyone.

686
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You see, I never wanted to marry Garcia, but we are part of the same companion.

687
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Companion?

688
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Gypsy tribe.

689
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We were promised to each other as children.

690
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Our people have closed Semenca like clan, kin.

691
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Marriage makes us strong, keeps Semenca powerful and safe.

692
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You lied to me once about being a gypsy.

693
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
How do I know you're telling the truth now?

694
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Because now I'm yours and now we can be happy.

695
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Together.

696
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Then let's go to South America together.

697
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The time must be right.

698
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And I will tell you when that time has come.

699
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Now promise me you will tell no one about us.

700
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Quickly, before someone comes.

701
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I promise.

702
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Take oath.

703
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
On my life.

704
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Your life is worth very little out here.

705
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Maria!

706
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I was just...

707
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Shun in a drag.

708
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
No, I wasn't listening.

709
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
In a few days I will clean out those busy little ears of yours with a dagger.

710
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
We'll camp here tonight.

711
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We're not far from Estepona.

712
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And I want to meet the captain of an English cargo ship there in any case.

713
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Hold gel to the Ronda in the morning.

714
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You're leaving us?

715
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You'll have more than one trip to the coast, compadre.

716
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And I have business elsewhere.

717
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
[music]

718
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000

719
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000

[singing]

723
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:43,000
What's the meaning of this song?

724
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's about a gypsy woman lost in love with a stranger.

725
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The stars look so bright tonight.

726
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I feel their heat.

727
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
How...

728
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
How long will you be away?

729
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Just a few days.

730
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Carmen, your husband is not 20 yards away.

731
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And he plays the guitar so well.

732
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But if he should...

733
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
There is no need to worry.

734
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Unless the music stops.

735
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You...

736
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You are the devil.

737
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Well, now you know who I am, kiss me.

738
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
There is a place we can go.

739
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
A short stroll from here by a stream.

740
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
[music]

741
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Goodbye, canary bed.

742
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We shall meet again before you're hanged.

743
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
[music]

744
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Oranges for sale.

745
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Juicy and ripe.

746
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The best in all Spain.

747
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Handsome sir, Mr. Officer.

748
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Can I interest you in an orange?

749
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
An orange?

750
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Ripe, luscious and sweet.

751
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Would you like a taste?

752
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I'm afraid I don't have time.

753
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Are you sure I can't tempt you?

754
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Look, I...

755
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Well, now you've come to mention it, I am feeling a little parched.

756
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It is very hot today.

757
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
My dress, it sticks to me.

758
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Perhaps I could try a segment?

759
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Of course, I wouldn't ask you to buy without first sampling the goods.

760
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
How is your thirst now?

761
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Sated.

762
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Then you are completely satisfied?

763
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

764
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I am a poor, honest orange seller.

765
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm often on this street and...

766
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
No, closer to my house.

767
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Your house?

768
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The white one with the high balcony in the main street.

769
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That house is yours?

770
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I had no idea it is so grand.

771
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And there always seems to be a party going on.

772
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
There's another tonight.

773
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I love parties.

774
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Oh, I'll be damned if you're not the prettiest orange seller I've ever seen.

775
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Each time I pass this house, I wonder what the view would be like from this balcony.

776
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm impressed.

777
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Not as much as I.

778
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Clambering.

779
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Clambering.

780
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
What was that?

781
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Well, look, my glass is empty.

782
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Don't go away.

783
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Hey, canary bird.

784
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I've been searching all over for you.

785
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I should have known you'd be in the biggest house on the street.

786
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Come up. I'll meet you at the door.

787
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You're from Granada and just passing through.

788
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You like the room?

789
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Fit for a queen. And you're dressed like one.

790
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Bought for me this afternoon by our host.

791
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
He thought I looked too pretty to be in rags.

792
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Now he says I'm the most beautiful woman in town.

793
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
He's right. I've never seen you look so beautiful.

794
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And I looking like a thief, which is what I am.

795
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
There's no better looking man than you in all of Spain.

796
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Garcia wants to know if there's any business.

797
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Look, there's my crayfish.

798
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Crayfish?

799
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
English officer. Because of the red jackets.

800
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Here's my business. His guineas belong to me.

801
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
If I catch you doing business like this again, I promise it'll be your last.

802
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Are you my rum that you can give me orders?

803
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
If Garcia is pleased...

804
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Garcia is a...

805
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You should be happy you're the only man I call Minchorro.

806
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I don't understand your bloody language.

807
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
My fancy. My lover.

808
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I was looking for you on the balcony.

809
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm sorry.

810
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Here you are.

811
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Thank you.

812
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
What are you doing with this beggar?

813
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Just because I invited you off the street, my sweet doesn't mean...

814
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
My sweet?

815
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
This is Garcia, a fellow orange seller.

816
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Carmen.

817
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
He has brought new supplies, Garcia.

818
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
This is officer.

819
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You go too far.

820
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Here's a guinea for your friend, Carmen. A servant will show him out.

821
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I shall wait for you in the dining room, my orange blossom.

822
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I shall be impressively, dearest one.

823
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I swear I could slip my hands around your throat and choke every last breath from your body.

824
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I can tell you're not in the mood for jest.

825
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Jest?

826
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Did you see the ring on his finger? I'll get it for you.

827
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
All I want from your millord is to meet him on the mountains with a gun in my fist.

828
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Then you will soon get your wish.

829
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I mean him to take me to the Sierra de Ronda.

830
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
We shall pass by a particular spot which I will make known to you.

831
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Then you must fall upon him and strip him of his belongings.

832
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Your best strategy would be to slit his throat, but I have a better plan.

833
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Go on.

834
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Let Garcia come up before you.

835
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You keep a little behind.

836
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
The crayfish is brave and skillful too, and he has good pistols.

837
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Do you understand?

838
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Now I must go.

839
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
We will be together again soon and live like kings and queens on my lord's riches.

840
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Are you sure this is where she said we should wait?

841
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
This is the place.

842
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Listen.

843
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Here they come.

844
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Cursy, I thought you said she'd be alone with her catch.

845
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's what she told me.

846
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
The idiot has brought along another crayfish for protection.

847
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But they'll have plenty of good guineas.

848
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Wait. I know that guard from the garrison in Seville.

849
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
He was a friend to me.

850
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You have no friends out here, senor.

851
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Pull up your mask.

852
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Now!

853
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
That's far enough.

854
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Your journey is at an end, my friend.

855
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Get away from your horses and empty your purses.

856
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Take their guns.

857
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Gladly.

858
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You're one of them?

859
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You think I'd let you touch me if I weren't being paid?

860
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You dirty cheap--

861
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Don't you dare touch her!

862
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Don Jose?

863
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Rodrigo, what are you doing here?

864
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
New posting, but Arthur Seville's on the hunt for you.

865
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You fool. Now we'll have to kill them.

866
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
What? No!

867
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Well, the officer is dead.

868
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Now we have a wounded guard to deal with.

869
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Not for long.

870
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Don't get away from him!

871
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Oh, my leg.

872
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Oh, Don Jose, please!

873
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Put your arm around my neck.

874
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Don Jose, please, don't let him kill me. Please!

875
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Guard, you breed. What do we want with awful?

876
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Drop him!

877
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Finish him off.

878
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Oh, Don Jose, please!

879
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
What are you doing?

880
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Setting him under the tree.

881
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It'll be okay. I'll get you some help.

882
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
We don't have time for this.

883
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Garcia!

884
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It would take a clever fellow to recognize that face now.

885
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
One in the back, the other in the face.

886
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Both unarmed.

887
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You're a very brave man.

888
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Any time you want to find out how brave, senor, you must let me know.

889
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
We've no time for this.

890
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Clear the road and let's get back to camp.

891
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You said you would be alone.

892
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,000
At the last minute, the crayfish decided to bring along another guard to protect me from bandits.

893
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Well, at least we got our catch.

894
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But at what expense?

895
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Garcia shall pay a heavy price for this.

896
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
You're a big man behind Garcia's back.

897
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But the thought of facing him turns your spine to custard.

898
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Someday I'll rid you of him and we will settle our account after the fashion of my country.

899
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Brave words, Paio.

900
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But don't ask me to hold my breath.

901
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:28,000
[MUSIC]

902
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
The Ace of Swords.

903
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
In my hands, a sword is a powerful weapon.

904
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Yet it cuts both ways.

905
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
There is great power in both love and hate.

906
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And for each triumph, there is defeat.

907
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I must be careful not to get cut by its double-edged blade.

908
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:53,000
[MUSIC]

909
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Garcia, your shirt, the blood.

910
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Not mine.

911
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It's Carmen.

912
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
She's fine. She's with the guard, yeah.

913
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You left them together?

914
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
He's nothing but a Thai soldier to her.

915
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You're sure?

916
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
If you have something to say, rock her it.

917
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
There's much I could say.

918
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
What's the game, Mariah?

919
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It's not me who is playing.

920
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Do I have to beat it out of you?

921
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I overheard them talking. I wasn't listening.

922
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
What did they say?

923
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Speak up, you little...

924
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
They're going away together.

925
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Going away?

926
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
To South America.

927
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
America?

928
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Have you no eyes? Have you not seen what's been going on between them?

929
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I thought...

930
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
She has slept with the Gorgia. In love.

931
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Her blood is poisoned.

932
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
In love?

933
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
She rockered this to you?

934
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Not in words.

935
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Then how could you know?

936
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I can know.

937
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Garcia...

938
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
They'll be here soon.

939
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Then we will find out.

940
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You must share your jest with us.

941
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Can you believe he actually buried the crayfish?

942
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm not sure what to believe.

943
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I know how fond you are of secrets and lies.

944
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
What's wrong?

945
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Dismount from your horses.

946
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'll take no more orders from you.

947
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Just do it, Don Jose.

948
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I'm not going to let you do this.

949
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I'm not going to let you do this.

950
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm not going to let you do this.

951
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm not going to let you do this.

952
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'll take no more orders from you.

953
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Just do it, Don Jose.

954
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Well?

955
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Maria says.

956
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
No, let her speak.

957
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
But...

958
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Garcia, I...

959
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Come on.

960
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Well, I...

961
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
We were walking in the mountains and they...

962
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I happened upon them and they said...

963
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Sly bitch.

964
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Heaves dropping slut.

965
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Child of a Lubny.

966
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Is it true about South America?

967
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
South...

968
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I don't know.

969
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yes.

970
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
We're in love.

971
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
She no longer cares for you.

972
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
We're going away together.

973
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But you know that...

974
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm tired of this!

975
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Don Jose.

976
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Carmen tells me you're good with a sword.

977
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Are you good with a sharp blade?

978
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I can handle one well enough.

979
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Then draw it!

980
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Garcia, no.

981
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Let them fight.

982
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Come on.

983
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
(Garcia grunts)

984
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
(Garcia screams)

985
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
(Garcia laughs)

986
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Be brave.

987
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You have one good arm left.

988
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I hope you use it well.

989
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
One arm is all I need to kill you.

990
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
(Garcia screams)

991
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Watch out!

992
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
(Garcia screams)

993
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Oh no!

994
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
(Garcia coughs)

995
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Please.

996
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Please.

997
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Oh, Carmen Chita.

998
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Now you are a widow.

999
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
No!

1000
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
What have you done?

1001
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
For the love of Carmen.

1002
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
The devil take your love.

1003
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You can buy her for a piazza.

1004
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Enough of you.

1005
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I will kill you.

1006
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I swear I will kill you.

1007
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Drop that knife!

1008
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You shall pay for this!

1009
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Drop it!

1010
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I take oath you shall both pay for this with your lives!

1011
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
(Garcia grunts)

1012
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
(Garcia pants)

1013
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:05,000
(soft music)

1014
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Garcia ought to have killed you.

1015
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
He has sent far more skillful men than you into the darkness.

1016
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Then how do you explain my victory?

1017
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
His time had come, that's all.

1018
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Just as yours will.

1019
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
(soft music)

1020
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
In gypsy law, does not the man who kills the leader of the gang

1021
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
become the leader himself and is entitled to the spoils?

1022
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Including the dead man's widow.

1023
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It is so.

1024
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Then you belong to me now.

1025
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I want you to wear this.

1026
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's my ring.

1027
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It was my mother's and her mother's before that.

1028
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Very well.

1029
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
No.

1030
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Let me put it on you.

1031
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'm not sure it will fit.

1032
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Let me try.

1033
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Perfect.

1034
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It presses my skin.

1035
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You'll get used to it.

1036
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Now our new life together can begin.

1037
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,000
(soft music)

1038
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Which part of the stream did you get that water?

1039
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Which part of the stream?

1040
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I've told you before.

1041
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
My people take water from different places in the stream for different things.

1042
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Upstream for drinking and cooking, lower down for washing bodies and clothes.

1043
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And lower still for horses, I know.

1044
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Superstition.

1045
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Like those cards you hold so sacred.

1046
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
We'll camp here tonight.

1047
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Get moving again in the morning.

1048
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm sick of riding.

1049
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We haven't set foot in a town in over two weeks.

1050
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
There are soldiers everywhere.

1051
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
There'll always be soldiers.

1052
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
We can't risk it yet.

1053
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
You can't risk it.

1054
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I'm tired of eating snake and raw acacia leaves.

1055
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And my stockings are ripped to shreds.

1056
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I'm up to here with life in the camp.

1057
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Come here.

1058
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
What's wrong?

1059
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Do you know, now that you're my Rom, I care for you less than when you were my Mincharo.

1060
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
A wife is supposed to be--

1061
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I won't be worried by you, ordered around by you, or above all, owned by you.

1062
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Careful.

1063
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Take care you don't drive me too far, canary bird.

1064
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Or I'll find another good fellow to serve you just as you served Garcia.

1065
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Carmen, I--

1066
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Please, I--

1067
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Don't you ever lay a hand on me again unless I allow you to.

1068
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The chariot is a card of force and control, with the power to shape all my wants and desires.

1069
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yet on their own, my emotions run wild and untamed, so I must be watchful.

1070
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Inner enemies are tougher to defeat than outer ones, thus can teach me more.

1071
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:49,000
A journey shall bring great learning.

1072
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Very nice to see--

1073
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Carmen.

1074
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Who is she?

1075
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Lucas.

1076
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
You know this woman.

1077
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Anita was just leaving.

1078
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I was not out, but--

1079
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
You had better go.

1080
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Will I see you tonight?

1081
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
No.

1082
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I haven't seen you in a while.

1083
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You seem to have found ways to fill your time.

1084
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
She's very pretty.

1085
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Oh, I've missed you.

1086
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So I see.

1087
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Come here.

1088
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I have very little time.

1089
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
When can we have more?

1090
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Give me a couple of days.

1091
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Four days and nothing.

1092
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
You could have sent word.

1093
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Are you frightened of the dark?

1094
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Where have you been?

1095
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
To the galleys and the devils in hell, what difference does it make?

1096
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Am I wrong to miss you when you're gone?

1097
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Well?

1098
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Still no sign of Maria?

1099
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
No.

1100
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
No sign.

1101
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
She's gone for good.

1102
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Or for bad.

1103
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Carmen.

1104
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Now with Garcia dead, why not change our lives forever?

1105
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Let's leave Spain and seek an honest livelihood in the new world.

1106
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
By doing what?

1107
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I don't know.

1108
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
My family used to farm.

1109
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
We were not born to plant cabbages.

1110
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Our fate is to live, Paio.

1111
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Is this what you call living?

1112
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Running like bandits?

1113
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
The threat of death hanging over us every day?

1114
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Anyway, I have business in Gibraltar.

1115
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Again?

1116
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Is that where you've been?

1117
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Your coffee tastes like sour vinegar.

1118
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Listen.

1119
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I've arranged a meeting for you with the smuggler, Nathan Ben-Joseph.

1120
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
He has cotton stuff that he cannot get through until you fetch them.

1121
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
He knows Garcia is dead and that you're alive.

1122
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But...

1123
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Don Jose.

1124
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
What would Adgibraltar compadre say if you failed them?

1125
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
What do I care what they say?

1126
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But I reckon on you.

1127
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I need you to do this.

1128
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Will you do this for me?

1129
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Very well.

1130
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And I shall wait for you in Cordoba.

1131
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Cordoba?

1132
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Easy, boy. What's your huffing?

1133
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
There's a fiesta there.

1134
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I shall go see it.

1135
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Then I will know what people come away with money and I can warn you.

1136
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
(Guitar music)

1137
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:34,000
What does it feel like to kill?

1138
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
To take the life of something so wild, so free,

1139
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
in the midst of the arena and all the splendour and noise?

1140
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I hear nothing but the breathing of the bull.

1141
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
But the roar of the crowd.

1142
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
At the point of death, we're aware of nothing but each other.

1143
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
You become the beast. The beast becomes you.

1144
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I'm at one with El Toro.

1145
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
At one.

1146
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
As you release him into the exquisite abyss.

1147
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Where we all must go in the end.

1148
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah. Where we must all go in the end.

1149
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
(Guitar music)

1150
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
(Guitar music)

1151
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Sir.

1152
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yes?

1153
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
There's a gypsy outside to see you, sir.

1154
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
A gypsy?

1155
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
A woman, sir.

1156
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
What does she want?

1157
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
She won't say unless she speaks to you personally, sir.

1158
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
She does say it's important.

1159
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Very well. Send her in.

1160
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Are you the captain?

1161
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I am. And you are?

1162
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
They call me Maria.

1163
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And what can I do for you?

1164
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
You're still looking for Don Jose Navarro?

1165
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
For the murder of a lieutenant, yes, we are.

1166
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
You have news of him?

1167
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Yes, I have news.

1168
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I've news that he and his lover, Carmen Chita,

1169
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
murdered two soldiers in their Sierra Doronda

1170
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
a little more than a week ago.

1171
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
That was the Navarro gang.

1172
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
They killed another man also, Garcia Altoeto,

1173
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
in cold blood.

1174
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Have you any idea where we might find these killers?

1175
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I'll take you to their camp. Tonight.

1176
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
(Guitar music)

1177
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Here, let me help you.

1178
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You like me, my traje de luces?

1179
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Your suit of lights will blind the crowd.

1180
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
You shine like a god.

1181
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I shall snatch the cockade and present it to you.

1182
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
The dance of life and death. I adore you.

1183
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Because I talk of blood and heat.

1184
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
And freedom.

1185
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And death.

1186
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And because you live inside the heartbeat

1187
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
where life itself can be taken at any moment.

1188
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I'd be a fool to want you any longer than the moment that is mine.

1189
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I must go.

1190
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I will watch from the gate, where it's closer

1191
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and I can almost reach out and touch.

1192
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
(Guitar music)

1193
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:21,000
El Toro, my darling.

1194
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
My one minchero.

1195
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Bravo! Bravo!

1196
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Lucas, I shall come to you.

1197
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
No! Call me cheater.

1198
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
You will come back to camp with me.

1199
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Traitorous!

1200
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
No, I...

1201
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Think very carefully before you lie to me again.

1202
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I would never lie to you.

1203
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I know what I've seen, what I have heard.

1204
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
But nothing of the strategy that lies beneath.

1205
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
That I can guess.

1206
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
There is business here.

1207
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And I know what kind.

1208
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
You are too ready to think low of me.

1209
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I only think what you give me cause to think.

1210
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Now it is your turn to be careful, Don Jose.

1211
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
There shall be no more ball fights for you.

1212
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I go where I please.

1213
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
From now, we ride together.

1214
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You shall not leave my sight.

1215
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
It is unwise to give me orders and commands.

1216
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
No, it is unwise to betray the man whose ring you wear.

1217
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Whose ring?

1218
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Had you forgotten you were even wearing it?

1219
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Our horses are ready and waiting.

1220
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
You seem to have thought of everything.

1221
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I've had much time.

1222
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Well?

1223
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I will ride with you.

1224
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I know the road I must take.

1225
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
(Guitar music)

1226
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
(Guitar music)

1227
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:34,000
The hanged man.

1228
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Accept what must be done.

1229
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
For as it is said, so it shall be.

1230
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Will you for once put aside those cards while I talk to you?

1231
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Well?

1232
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Do you want to know why I'm not in Gibraltar where you sent me?

1233
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Was Nathan Ben Joseph not there?

1234
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
He was there.

1235
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And so was Juanito.

1236
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
He told me he'd seen you with a picador named Lucas in Zacateen on your way to Cordova.

1237
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
So, you were not visiting a fiesta after all?

1238
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Lucas is...

1239
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
He is a man who has earned much at bullfights.

1240
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I thought we must make use of him or his money.

1241
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Make use of him how?

1242
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
By enrolling him in our gang.

1243
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So you can kill me as I kill Garcia?

1244
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
No!

1245
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
A new gang needs building as we're all that's left.

1246
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
He would be a good start.

1247
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
In any case, I want neither him nor his money.

1248
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And I forbid you to speak to him again.

1249
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Beware, Don Jose.

1250
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
If anyone defies me to do a thing, it is very quickly done.

1251
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Listen.

1252
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I'll forget everything.

1253
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I won't mention anything to you again, but swear one thing.

1254
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
That you will come with me to South America.

1255
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
No.

1256
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
But we can live there quietly.

1257
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I won't go to America.

1258
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
But why?

1259
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm very well here.

1260
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
That's because you're near the picador.

1261
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Lucas has nothing to do with it.

1262
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
You can be very sure he is a man who won't make old bones.

1263
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
None of us will.

1264
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm destined to die at your hands, Bayer.

1265
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Me first and then you.

1266
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I know how it will be.

1267
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
You and your damn fates.

1268
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
On the very first morning I saw you, I'd met a priest at my door.

1269
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It was an omen.

1270
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Then the cards in my cell, remember?

1271
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I remember.

1272
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I also remember you saying we could be happy together.

1273
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
We have been.

1274
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
But we could be more than just a...

1275
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
A night here, a few days there.

1276
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Snatched moments of a shelter in an endless storm.

1277
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
You ask too much.

1278
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And you ask too little.

1279
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You're a good bandit, hombre.

1280
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Handsome and strong, but a bad poet.

1281
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I want more than this.

1282
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And there is your weakness.

1283
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
If you hadn't gone to Corlebar with Lucas...

1284
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Then why should I quarrel with him?

1285
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I'm tired of killing your lovers.

1286
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Carmen!

1287
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
My shoulder.

1288
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Here! Behind the wagon!

1289
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Soldiers?

1290
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
A whole battalion, I think.

1291
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's a flesh wound.

1292
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The bullet's gone straight through.

1293
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Well, it seems this is the hour.

1294
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Looks like it's fight or surrender.

1295
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I won't go to prison.

1296
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
If we stay here, we're dead.

1297
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Then shoot me and I'm done with it.

1298
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
You can get away.

1299
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
No, there's a chance I could make it to the horses.

1300
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I won't leave you. Wait here!

1301
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Where else would I go?

1302
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
We're here, ma'am!

1303
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Get on the horse while I cover you.

1304
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Hurry!

1305
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Let's go!

1306
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
How would they just happen on a camp like that?

1307
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Perhaps a little bird sang them a song.

1308
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Which road?

1309
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I'm not sure.

1310
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
We need to fix that wound.

1311
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And your leg.

1312
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
That's little more than a graze.

1313
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Come on. This way, I think.

1314
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I'm not sure how much further I can...

1315
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
A little rest, I think.

1316
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Well, if I'm not mistaken...

1317
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Yes.

1318
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Look, through the trees.

1319
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And hold in.

1320
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,000
What did you tell the innkeeper?

1321
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
That you were thrown from your horse.

1322
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And your leg?

1323
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
An old wound.

1324
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
That is still bleeding?

1325
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
You think he doesn't know what we are?

1326
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
By the time he finds anyone to tell, we'll be long gone.

1327
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Yeah.

1328
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Your wound's cleaned and dressed.

1329
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
You make a much better nurse than I do.

1330
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Here.

1331
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Take another sip of this.

1332
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:57,000
What are you smiling at?

1333
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Looks like we're all out of choices.

1334
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I don't follow.

1335
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Surely you can see we must change our life now.

1336
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Change it to what?

1337
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We shall go away to a new place.

1338
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And live on air and fairy tales?

1339
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
We have 120 gold ounces buried under an oak not far from here.

1340
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And then there's the money from Ben Joseph.

1341
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
It's too late for that.

1342
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
But we can get away. There's still time.

1343
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
You've always been a fool.

1344
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
For loving you?

1345
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
For wanting you?

1346
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Yes, all those things.

1347
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I don't understand.

1348
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Because you are a simpleton.

1349
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Today, I...

1350
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Did I not save your life?

1351
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Did I ask you to?

1352
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I chose to.

1353
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You chose to save it this morning, only to take it away tonight.

1354
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Carmen Cheetah.

1355
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Don't you love me anymore?

1356
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I can never give you what you want.

1357
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Have I always meant nothing to you?

1358
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Nothing.

1359
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And everything.

1360
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Sometimes I wonder at the difference.

1361
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Shall I explain it to you?

1362
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You'd be foolish to even try.

1363
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
My head!

1364
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
You have it spinning!

1365
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
My watch.

1366
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I never did give it back.

1367
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Carmen.

1368
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Time.

1369
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
How beautiful it sounds as it chimes away.

1370
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
You'd think it would last forever.

1371
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Perhaps it can.

1372
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Dangerous and invisible.

1373
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
It's here, it's gone.

1374
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
We don't even know, and then...

1375
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
The music stops.

1376
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
You are leaving?

1377
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I...

1378
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I better check we were not followed by the soldiers.

1379
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
While I'm gone, will you...

1380
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Think about us?

1381
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I have thought.

1382
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I'm coming to the end of my patience.

1383
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And my courage.

1384
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Make your mind up.

1385
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Or else I must make up mine.

1386
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
My mind has been made up for a very long time.

1387
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:20,000
The innkeeper has fled and there was a scout on the road.

1388
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
The soldiers will be here any time.

1389
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
They do not fight on the road.

1390
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
There is a wood close by.

1391
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Death is transformation, the soul lives on.

1392
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
We must go!

1393
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
The candle is extinguished only because the day is...

1394
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I'm sick of your cards and your spells!

1395
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
The river will reach into the sea, rise into the clouds,

1396
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
then rain onto the land to flow into the river again.

1397
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I have had enough of this, do you hear?

1398
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Nothing is destroyed because nothing can be destroyed.

1399
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Carmen!

1400
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Accept death will happen as it must.

1401
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Will you please come with me?

1402
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Now!

1403
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I am ready.

1404
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I am ready.

1405
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:15,000
The innkeeper must let loose our horses before he fled.

1406
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I love the moonlit forest.

1407
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
We must hurry.

1408
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
There is deep longing in such a place.

1409
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I fear the soldiers are closing in.

1410
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
You don't feel it?

1411
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
At this moment I feel a great many things.

1412
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
The aromas, earth and wood.

1413
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Would you please...

1414
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And the sounds...

1415
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It is the wind in the trees.

1416
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
No, not the wind.

1417
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Not tonight.

1418
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It is the breathing of the bull.

1419
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I have come far enough.

1420
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Why are you stopping?

1421
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
We must go, the soldiers, I implore you!

1422
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
This is the place.

1423
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
See how the trees reach out to the moon.

1424
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
You know, it is you who has been my ruin.

1425
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I have been nothing but what I am.

1426
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
It is because of you that I am a murderer.

1427
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Did I not tell you I would be the gallows you were hanged upon?

1428
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Carmen, my Carmen, let me save you and save myself with you.

1429
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Jose, what you ask is impossible.

1430
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I don't love you anymore.

1431
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,000
If I liked, I might tell you some other lie, but I don't choose to give myself the trouble.

1432
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
You crushed the life from my body with your callous words.

1433
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Everything is over between us.

1434
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Then you love Lucas?

1435
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Yes, I have loved him as I loved you for an instant.

1436
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Less than I loved you perhaps, but now I don't love anything.

1437
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And I hate myself for ever loving you.

1438
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Carmen!

1439
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I cast myself at your feet.

1440
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Please, please!

1441
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Remember the happy moments we've shared together.

1442
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
They are already forgotten.

1443
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I will continue my brigands life if it will please you.

1444
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Everything, anything.

1445
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I will give you whatever you wish, only please love me again.

1446
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Love you again?

1447
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
That's not possible.

1448
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Live with you.

1449
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I will not do it.

1450
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Very well.

1451
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I see both your mind and your heart are set against me.

1452
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I hold this blade before you.

1453
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Will you not even look frightened?

1454
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
In suit for mercy?

1455
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I will never give in to you.

1456
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
For the last time I ask you, will you stay with me?

1457
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
No!

1458
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
You may choose to kill me, but Carmen will always be free.

1459
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Here.

1460
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
What are you doing?

1461
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Taking off your ring.

1462
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Please, no!

1463
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I have no more use for this.

1464
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I cast it into the brushwood and to hell with it.

1465
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
No!

1466
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I told you!

1467
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:02,000
My love, I told you.

1468
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Bury me in the forest.

1469
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
In the forest.

1470
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Oh, my love.

1471
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:26,000
My love.

1472
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
My love.

1473
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I shall...

1474
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I shall dig your grave with my knife.

1475
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:54,000
The birds shall sing above while the flowers grow around you.

1476
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I will make sure of that.

1477
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
My love.

1478
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
My love.

1479
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
My love.

1480
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
