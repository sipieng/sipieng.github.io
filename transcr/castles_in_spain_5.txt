*[Previously in episode 4]
[In the hotel lounge]*

Teresa: Are you as angry as you look?
Mayer: Angrier.
Teresa: Have some coffee.
Mayer: No, thank you.
Teresa: What made you angry?
Mayer: You and your whole stricken family.
Teresa: What have we done now?
Mayer: You’ve conned me.
Teresa: In what way?
Mayer: You’re all playing me off against each other.
Teresa: You’re not just looking for excuses.
Mayer: For what?
Teresa: Well, you’re no nearer finding Jock Cameron, are you?
Mayer: Maybe that was the whole object of the exercise.
Teresa: What? Not finding him, you mean?
Mayer: I’m beginning to think so.
Teresa: You’ve bitten off more than you can chew. That’s what you’re really saying, isn’t it?
Mayer: Tell me something.
Teresa: Yes?
Mayer: Jocelyn Coleman.
Teresa: Yuck.
Mayer: Was he in Spain with your grandfather?
Teresa: Yes.
Mayer: I’d like to ask you something else about Spain.
Teresa: Well, I’m sure you would, but I haven’t time. I must fly. Literally.
Mayer: You’re going back to London?
Teresa: I have a funeral to attend.
Mayer: It’s a silly thing to say in the circumstances, but, well, I’m glad you’re going to it.
Teresa: Tell you another silly thing. I feel really angry now because I can’t apologise to my grandfather for what I thought about him.
Mayer: Save your anger for Jocelyn.
Teresa: He’ll never know what hit him.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Is there an aura that comes from policemen, private eyes, income tax inspectors, and those who are denigrated by sinners of various types? An aura that breeds silence and secrecy and sullenness and resentment. Silence, secrecy, sullenness, resentment, all evaporate and vanish, disappear, if you can persuade that aura to fade into nothing. The secret of life, I told myself, is not to want to know too much. It’s to settle for being a happy idiot. It’s to let great secrets seek you out and tell themselves to you, while Philip Marlowe wastes shoe leather walking down those mean streets. This train of thought carried me back to my hotel room.

*[In the hotel room]
[Phone Ringing]*

Mayer: Hello?
Lovat: Is that Mr Mayer?
Mayer: Yes.
Lovat: Hello, Mr Mayer. My name is Lovat, Dr Lovat. I’m a friend of Agnes McLauchlan.
Mayer: Yes?
Lovat: Mr Mayer, are you still interested in Jock Cameron?
Mayer: I don’t know.
Lovat: Well, that’s a pretty dusty answer, Mayer.
Mayer: A reflection of my own confusion.
Lovat: Hmm. Why were you looking for Cameron?
Mayer: Somebody asked me to.
Lovat: And now that somebody is dead, and you’re wondering if that releases you from your obligation.
Mayer: That’s it in a nutshell.
Lovat: Perhaps that particular death released a lot of us from obligations.
Mayer: Shall I come and see you?
Lovat: I’ll send a car for you.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> I stood in the hotel foyer while the minutes dripped past like raindrops, and I had a sense of something ended, or perhaps of something that had never really begun.
> 
> 
> And then suddenly, there was someone at my side, a small compact man with piercing blue eyes. He was wearing jeans and a brown suede jacket, and there was something ageless about his face. Something burned into it by sun and suffering. A timeless face that asked perpetually a timeless question.
> 
> Who built Thebes of the seven gates?
> 

*[In the hotel foyer]*

Cameron: Your name Mayer?
Mayer: Yes.
Cameron: Dr. Lovat sent me to pick you up. I’ve got the motor outside.
Mayer: What made you come out of hiding, Jock?
Cameron: I had a job to do.
Mayer: Mission accomplished.
Cameron: I don’t think you could say that.
Mayer: Could I say that about my own mission?
Cameron: We’ll talk about that in the motor.

*[In the car]*

Mayer: Are you sure this is your car?
Cameron: No fancy enough for you.
Mayer: Something tells me this car is hot.
Cameron: Well, open the bloody windies. Fasten your seat belt.
Mayer: You’ve heard that Forrest is dead?
Cameron: Bad news travels fast.
Mayer: And good men are scarce, right?
Cameron: He was something more than that. He was a great man.
Mayer: A great soldier isn’t necessarily a great human being.
Cameron: I’ll give you that. But Sandy Forrest was both.
Mayer: I think he was less than honest with me.
Cameron: That’s just another way of saying that he thought you could handle yourself no matter what happened.
Mayer: Very flattering. But I might have been more flattered if he confided in me more fully.
Cameron: I’ll tell you something.
Mayer: I’ll make a refreshing change.
Cameron: I didn’t know what you brought into this thing at all.
Mayer: I don’t even know what thing you’re talking about.
Cameron: Ask whatever you like. If the answer’s classified, well, I’ll classify it.
Mayer: You’re crazy with power.
Cameron: Aye, that’ll be right.
Mayer: Do you remember a poster from the last war? It said, “Is your journey really necessary?”
Cameron: I mind it fine.
Mayer: Was my journey up here really necessary?
Cameron: Where you getting that?
Mayer: I think that Forrest knew where you were all the time.
Cameron: Maybe he did.
Mayer: Then why the charade then?
Cameron: Need doot you’ll hear theory about that.
Mayer: You and Forrest made brilliant reputations in Spain, right?
Cameron: So I’ve heard.
Mayer: But when the Hitler War broke out, the army didn’t want to know you.
Cameron: Maybe we wore the wrong old school ties.
Mayer: Forrest was public school and university. His qualifications were impeccable.
Cameron: He was a premature anti-fascist.
Mayer: Now what the hell does that mean?
Cameron: It means bugger off. We don’t want to know you.
Mayer: Were you tied with the same brush?
Cameron: Everybody that fought against Franco was.
Mayer: Including the gay Mr Coleman.
Cameron: Coleman never fought against Franco.
Mayer: But he was in Spain during the Civil War.
Cameron: He was in the British Embassy in Madrid. He did us some small favours.
Mayer: Small is right.
Cameron: I don’t get that.
Mayer: Was one of the small favours helping to smuggle a child out of the country?
Cameron: Right.
Mayer: You’ve moved in influential circles in your time, Jock.
Cameron: True. Well, it was Forrest that fixed things up about the kid.
Mayer: And how did he manage that?
Cameron: Well, he and Coleman went to the same school. I think Coleman fancied him. Maybe that’s putting it mildly.
Mayer: What makes you say that?
Cameron: That kid cost Coleman his career. Somebody blabbed about it. Maybe even Coleman himself. Anyway, that was him kaput. He was sent home.
Mayer: Was it your child, Cameron?
Cameron: No. A lot of folk thought that. I’ve a feeling that Agnes McLoughlin maybe even believed it. But she was wrong. It happened exactly the way I’d tellt it. I found it in a shell hole.
Mayer: I believe you.
Cameron: I don’t give a bugger whether you believe me or no.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> We left the city behind and drove through smug, prosperous little towns, where every house had its own lawn and regimented roses. Some of them had ponds stocked with fish. Goldfish, of course. Not a garden gnome in sight. The only gnomes recognized by the people in these houses could not be persuaded to leave Zurich. Then the houses began to space themselves out, becoming further and further apart. Until finally, we came to one that stood absolutely on its own.
> 
> 
> A man was standing at the gate, staring down the road as though the isolation had suddenly become too much and had driven him out in search of company.
> 

*[In the car]
[Outside Dr. Lovat’s house]*

Cameron: End of the line.
Mayer: I still have some questions to ask you.
Cameron: Put them to Dr. Lovat.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> The car drove off, and Dr. Lovat watched it go, as though for a fleeting moment, he had suddenly recalled a shining dream of when the world was young and the clean air carried only songs of possibility.
> 
> 
> And for a moment, I felt a pang of bitter jealousy, a sense of being excluded from his memories, faith, innocence.I envied him as I followed him into the house.
> 

*[In Dr. Lovat’s house]*

Lovat: Please sit down. Well, Mayer, so you finally found Jock Cameron.
Mayer: Did I?
Lovat: Something bothering you?
Mayer: You made the mistake of making it all too easy.
Lovat: A strange objection, if I may say so.
Mayer: Oh, it was well done as far as it went. Old Henderson’s initial hostility and reluctance to talk, then his sudden change of heart. That leads me, or perhaps rather more accurately, manipulates me in the direction of Agnes McLauchlan and her romantic story.
Lovat: All true and verifiable.
Mayer: Granted, all good stuff. The path to Jock Cameron, intriguing and not too difficult, until a strange thing happens.
Lovat: And what was that?
Mayer: Cameron decides to surface of his own accord.
Lovat: In what way do you find that significant?
Mayer: I think that something happened to change my role in this whole affair, whatever that may have been.
Lovat: I’m in a bit of a dilemma here.
Mayer: In what way?
Lovat: I can’t say anything without saying too much.
Mayer: Does that matter anymore?
Lovat: You mean now that Sandy Forrest is dead?
Mayer: That’s exactly what I mean.
Lovat: I’m not going into details, but you are due some kind of explanation.
Mayer: Thank you.
Lovat: You’re quite right. The whole Jock business was a red herring.
Mayer: Why?
Lovat: We were using you as a decoy.
Mayer: Oh, great, especially since decoys are almost by definition expendable.
Lovat: You were never in any danger from Hanrahan.
Mayer: I seem to have heard that name somewhere before.
Lovat: I shouldn’t think so.
Mayer: What makes you say that?
Lovat: Hanrahan is a hitman, a very unusual hitman.
Mayer: What makes him unusual?
Lovat: He always worked for the partner, his daughter Nora.
Mayer: I’ve met them and lived to tell the tale.
Lovat: Hanrahan only kills those he’s paid to kill.
Mayer: He has a certain sense of humour anyway.
Lovat: I’ve never heard him accused of that.
Mayer: He went on about a mysterious character called Hanrahan.
Lovat: That sounds more like Norah’s style. They probably underrated you. People like the Hanrahans are prone to tunnel vision.
Mayer: I told them a yarn that was, well, not quite a lie, but a reinterpretation of the fact, so to speak.
Lovat: What were they pretending to be?
Mayer: A special branch.
Lovat: And what made you suspicious?
Mayer: They said they’d been checking out on me. Yet when I gave my bookshop a false name, they didn’t notice.
Lovat: Hmm. As I said, they underrated you.
Mayer: I’d hate you to make the same mistake, Dr. Lovat.
Lovat: How about this for a scenario?
Mayer: We have an organisation that is or is regarded as being a danger to the state.
Lovat: This is pure speculation, of course.
Mayer: Shall I speculate some more?
Lovat: Please do.
Mayer: Right. My hypothetical organisation has a problem, the kind of problem that seems almost endemic in the kind of organisation it is. Someone in the organisation or close to it has been passing on information.
Lovat: The technical term is mole.
Mayer: I was part of a scheme to unearth that mole.
Lovat: You may not have noticed it, Mayer, but you’ve suddenly stopped being hypothetical.
Mayer: Maybe the time has passed for hypotheses.
Lovat: Maybe. Well, it’s been an interesting conversation.
Mayer: One last thing which perhaps you know nothing about.
Lovat: What’s that?
Mayer: The business about the paintings.
Lovat: Oh, nothing mysterious or sinister there. Forrest needed money, so he sold them off.
Mayer: Why copies then?
Lovat: Because he liked them, but not in the kind of way that comes of exclusive ownership.
Mayer: I got the impression that he was quite well-heeled.
Lovat: Oh, he was. He was. But even the well-heeled have temporary difficulties.
Mayer: Yes?
Lovat: Well, I first came across Sandy Forrest in Spain. I was with an ambulance unit and had some ridiculous ambition to become a doctor, but my background was respectable poverty and this was before the days of university grants. After Spain, Forrest financed me through university. It was Sandy Forrest who paid Henderson’s bills in the nursing home. It was Sandy Forrest who kept Agnes McLauchlan afloat after her father died. God knows how many more he helped, for he never talked about it.
Mayer: What do you intend to do about the mole?
Lovat: I intend not to say another word on that subject.
Mayer: How do I get back to the hotel?
Lovat: Jock will take you back when he returns.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Ten weary minutes passed before Jock returned and drove me back through the smug little towns and their houses with their manicured lawns and their regimented shrubs and flowers. A small, polite rain had begun to fall and Jock drove through it in a silence that had begun to become oppressive and excluding and irritating enough to provoke a counter reaction in me.
> 

*[In the car]*

Mayer: Were you ever in a Trappist monastery?
Cameron: Once.
Mayer: In Spain?
Cameron: Where else?
Mayer: How long did you spend in it?
Cameron: Just as long as it took to kill a sniper.
Mayer: Do you like cars, Jock?
Cameron: I can take them or leave them.
Mayer: This is one you preferred to take, isn’t it?
Cameron: Is that right?
Mayer: Last time I was in this car was with Hanrahan and Norah.
Cameron: Then you were in bad company.
Mayer: Yeah. I wonder what became of them.
Cameron: I wonder.
Mayer: Maybe they were terminated with extreme prejudice. Is that the phrase?
Cameron: That’s the phrase.
Mayer: What exactly does it mean?
Cameron: It means they weren’t as bloody clever as they thought.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> Back at the hotel, I looked out of my window at Glasgow for the last time. It said nothing to me, nor I to it. We had not sought each other’s acquaintance, nor had there been any love at first sight. All that we had to say to each other had been said. It was the same day, but in a different country and at a different time. I had a sense of having come full circle.
> 
> 
> The bookshop smelled the same, the same aroma of other people’s thoughts. And as I stood there savouring it, I was aware that someone had come into the shop. And I turned to meet the mocking smile of a man I knew, a blind man whose name was Jocelyn Coleman.
> 

*[In the bookshop]*

Coleman: Glad to be back in London, Mayer.
Mayer: Yes.
Coleman: Won’t you ask me to sit down?
Mayer: All right. Over here.
Coleman: Ah. Thank you. So, you found Jock Cameron.
Mayer: I did rather more than that, Coleman.
Coleman: Really?
Mayer: I’m afraid I blew your cover.
Coleman: I don’t think so, dear boy.
Mayer: Oh, no?
Coleman: No, it’s a long story.
Mayer: Does it begin with a child being smuggled out of Spain, say, 50 years ago?
Coleman: Who told you that?
Mayer: Jock Cameron. He said the incident cost you your career.
Coleman: What else did he say?
Mayer: He said you were in love with Forrest, and you had been ever since your school days.
Coleman: Jock is an unreconstructed romantic.
Mayer: You, on the other hand, are not, nor have you ever been.
Coleman: No, I have a terrible feeling you’re working up to something nasty.
Mayer: Suppose Cameron was wrong. Suppose your masters offered you a deal.
Coleman: What a lively imagination you have, dear boy.
Mayer: It gets livelier.
Coleman: Do go on.
Mayer: The deal was that they’d forget all about your breach of regulations on one condition.
Coleman: That condition being that I spied on Forrest and his friends.
Mayer: You admit it?
Coleman: Cheerfully.
Mayer: Where I come from, that’s treachery. What kind of information were you passing on?
Coleman: Oh, rubbish mostly. No better than gossip. Matahari I was not.
Mayer: Yet you kept on with it after Spain.
Coleman: Hmm. Maybe treachery is habit forming.
Mayer: You make it sound very boring.
Coleman: Very boring it is, dear boy. Except for one thing.
Mayer: What was that?
Coleman: I told Forrest.
Mayer: I find that very difficult to believe.
Coleman: Then you are denying the existence of any kind of love that isn’t heterosexual.
Mayer: So you were a mole after all.
Mayer: Absolutely. It just happened that you, dear boy, were looking in the wrong mole hill.
Mayer: What was Forrest’s reaction when you told him?
Coleman: He thought it was a huge joke.
Mayer: A long time to keep a joke going, I would have thought.
Mayer: He used to tell me about an old aunt of his who would never throw anything out. She had a stock reply for anyone who tried to persuade her to get rid of years of accumulated rubbish. Keep a thing for seven years, she’d say, and it’s bound to come in handy.
Mayer: And is that what happened?
Mayer: Yes. What I’m trying to say is that because he made his reputation in Spain, people tend to forget that Forrest was a Scot. But he was, very much so. He had strong views about North Sea oil and the dumping of nuclear waste, things like that. And NATO, of course. His native land, he used to declare was being reduced to the status of Fortress Scotland.
Mayer: So he set up a freedom movement?
Coleman: No.
Mayer: But you said?
Coleman: He set up two freedom movements.
Mayer: You’re not serious?
Coleman: I swear to you that I am. Nowadays, I think the technical term is disinformation. The whole purpose of the Harry Lauder team, as Forrest always referred to us, was to distract attention away from the A-team who were getting on with the real job. Don’t ask me who they are, because I don’t know. Forrest kept that information close to his chest.
Mayer: Who were the Harry Lauder team?
Coleman: Forrest, Dr. Lovat, Jock Cameron, and myself. Though MI5 didn’t know that, of course.
Mayer: What kind of things did you do?
Coleman: It wasn’t so much that we actually did anything. It was the atmosphere we created. Our briefing was, in Forrest’s words, “to create and maintain a high profile of comic ineptitude.” Like the assassination that never happened, because at the critical moment, the assassin was seized with a violent bout of diarrhea. Or there was the occasion when one of the gangs stored dynamite in a village hall without telling anyone else about it. Unfortunately, he stored it inside the old-fashioned stove.
Mayer: Surely MI5 must have realized they were being sent out.
Coleman: Oh, paranoia has no sense of humor.
Mayer: So who was supposed to be supplying you with all this disinformation from your phone organization?
Coleman: Dr. Lovat. He was my disgruntled source as far as MI5 were concerned. Cameron was Metro Man. Forrest was the bumbling idealist who picked up all the tabs. Did I ever tell you about the paintings?
Mayer: You never told me anything. All you did was utter dire warnings about Jock Cameron.
Coleman: Part of the general mystification. If I remember correctly, at the time, you said that you had not yet made up your mind to become involved.
Mayer: The paintings. You sold them, didn’t you?
Coleman: I sold the copies. MI5 is filled with people who are now the proud owners of bogus Lowry’s, bogus Wallace’s, or whatever.
Mayer: What a superlative con man you are, Coleman.
Coleman: Oh, what a thing to say to a poor blind man.
Mayer: So what happened to the Harry Lauder outfit?
Coleman: The Americans happened to it. Ever since NATO, we’ve had to cooperate with the Americans on all matters that might concern that organization. Copies of every memo to whatever actors happen to be inhabiting the White House at the moment. MI5 don’t particularly like it, but they go along with it. That’s how the CIA eventually became aware of the Harry Lauder outfit. And being the kind of gung-ho chaps they are, you can probably guess how they reacted.
Mayer: Well, MI5 saw a bunch of jokers. They saw a subversive organization.
Coleman: Right. Then I heard a rumor that they were in contact with a Hanrahan.
Mayer: The CIA brought in the hit team.
Coleman: That’s the way they operate. MI5 folklore has it that they’ve been responsible for the death of one Scottish nationalist already. His murder remains unsolved to this day.
Mayer: And you made the reasonable assumption that the Harry Lauder outfit was next on the list.
Coleman: A logical deduction, insofar as logic ever enters into these things. Forrest was a great believer in getting his retaliation in first. So we concocted a fiction for MI5. The Harry Lauder outfit was being torn apart by internal dissension. Its leader was a very sick man. God knows that was truer than we realized. And had lost all control. Lovat wanted to get out. Cameron had gone berserk and was making all kinds of wild threats against all things American. Forrest was worried sick, especially since he didn’t exactly know where Cameron was. All very touching. Not a dry seat in the house.
Mayer: So I was sent to find the berserk Cameron.
Coleman: That was the story.
Mayer: But why me?
Coleman: Because your grandfather was Cameron’s great buddy in Spain. He gave the story a final ring of authenticity.
Mayer: You’re not telling me the truth even yet, Coleman.
Coleman: Oh, what a terribly wounding remark.
Mayer: I know I was a decoy. You wanted me to provoke the Americans into making a move.
Coleman: I had hoped to spare you that realization.
Mayer: It worked, didn’t it?
Coleman: Like a charm, if I may coin a phrase.
Mayer: Was Theresa involved in the plot?
Coleman: No. She ran errands for us, nothing more.
Mayer: You realize, of course, that the Americans won’t leave it at this.
Coleman: Oh, it doesn’t seem to matter much anymore.

**Monologue by Mayer:**

> The place was crowded for the final act. The audience or congregation or whatever is the word for those who attend a cremation consisted mostly of old men. They wore shiny blue serge suits and black ties. And they spoke in whispers as though anything louder would disturb the dead man they had gathered to honor. Some of them lacked an arm, some a leg. None of them lacked a kind of pride.
> 
> 
> Then the shoulders straightened and the head snapped back as Jock Cameron was suddenly there standing in front of the coffin.
> 

*[In the crematorium]*

Cameron: Comrades, a lot of you are bound to remember Captain George Nathan. You’ll recall the riding boots he wore that shone like the Spanish sun and his wee swagger stick with a gold knob. We used to think he was immortal, that the wee swagger stick with something magic, for he was eyeing the thick of the action, yet he seemed to bear a charmed life. But the magic ran out at Brunetti. And as George Nathan lay dying, he asked us to sing him out of life, which we did. Comrades of the International Brigade, we owe nae less to Sandy Forrest, a great soldier and a loyal comrade. So I ask you to be upstanding and Jock end the song without me telling you.

*[People sing]*

🎵 There’s a valley in Spain called Jalama.
🎵 That’s a place that we all know so well.
🎵 For it is here that we wasted our manhood and most of our old age as well.
🎵 From this valley they tell us we’re leaving, but don’t hasten to bid us adieu.
🎵 For even though we make our departure, we’ll be back in an hour or two.
🎵 Oh, we’re proud of our Lincoln Battalion and the marathon record it’s made.
🎵 Please do us this little favor and take this last word to Brigade.
🎵 You’ll never be happy with strangers.
🎵 They would not understand you as we.
🎵 So remember the Jalama Valley and the old men who wait patiently.
