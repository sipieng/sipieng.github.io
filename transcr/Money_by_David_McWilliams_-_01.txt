**第一段：阿尚戈骨与人类早期商业的起源**  
BBC Sounds Music, Radio, Podcasts. The Ishango Bone dates from around 18,000 years BCE. Discovered on the banks of the Congo in 1950, it is a baboon's femur with a series of tiny little cut-out notches. Notches are divided over the artefact's purpose, but it is speculated that each notch indicates an amount owed by someone to somebody else. If the Ishango Bone was indeed a commercial tally stick, its notches also represent the first known example of value, a highly sophisticated concept.

**第二段：人类社会的发展及货币的早期萌芽**  
In the standard account of the history of our species, humans roamed, then we settled, then we roamed again before settling down around 5000 BCE in small communities that would come to be largely organised around money. But the Ishango Bone theory of early commerce suggests that our ancestors may well have been thinking about money far, far earlier. The people who notched the Ishango Bone were hunter-gatherers on the cusp of a new world.

**第三段：人类如何适应金钱**  
Anthropologists often refer to humans as a pyrophyte species, one that has been shaped by the technology fire. The thread linking the observations in this series is that, in the course of the last five millennia, we have become, and with apologies to linguistic purists because I made this word up myself, we have become a plutophyte species, meaning a species that has adapted to, and been adapted by another technology, money.

**第四段：金钱作为社会技术的核心作用**  
In the past, when trying to explain how our ancestors developed, we often focused on a physical technology that aided our progress, the invention of the wheel, the discovery of coal or the arrival of the plough. But what about social technologies that helped us organise in pursuit of common goals by enhancing human cooperation? One of these tools was language, which humans had developed over tens of thousands of years to communicate with each other in a more sophisticated and collaborative fashion. With the advent of agriculture a few thousand years ago, that social cooperation really took off.

**第五段：金钱如何推动早期文明**  
As humans started to colonise the land, we generated food surpluses that could be taxed by the state. Early civilisations that adopted money acquired a competitive advantage over others, leading to innovations that radically changed the story of modern humanity. Today, whether we like it or not, our entire world revolves around this strange invented notion that Vladimir Lenin described as the Great Illusion.

**第六段：金钱的复杂性及其与人类的关系**  
Money is at the centre of modern culture. People living thousands of miles apart who don't understand each other's language or customs understand money and speak to each other through money. Money is a force that dictates the flow of people, goods and ideas around the globe. Money defines the relationship between worker and employer, buyer and seller, merchant and producer.

**第七段：金钱对人类社会的双面影响**  
But not only that. It defines the bond between the governed and the governor, the state and the citizen. Money unlocks pleasure, puts a price on desire, art, creativity. It motivates us to strive, to achieve, invent and take risks. Money also brings out humanity's darker side, invoking greed, envy, hatred, violence, often driven by the prospect of vast financial gain.

**第八段：金钱的本质与社会信念**  
Money is complex because humans are complex. We all believe in it and therefore it must be real. But is it real? In fact, money is abstract and it's only given value as long as the rest of us, or at least enough of the rest of us, believe in it. Money like faith is a product of the human imagination that we invented to help us negotiate an increasingly complex and interrelated world.

1. **"Notches are divided over the artefact's purpose"**  
   **修改为：Notches divide opinion over the artefact's purpose**。  
   **依据**：上下文提到对“刻痕的目的”有争议，可能是语音识别出错导致的误读。  

2. **"pyrophyte" 和 "plutophyte"**  
   **保留原词**，但需确认其拼写准确，因为 "plutophyte" 是作者自造词。
