00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, dramatized for radio by Jonathan Holloway.

[Music]

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,440
Now here's a comforting thought. The hands of all our 4,000 electric clocks

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:29,960
in the Bloomsbury Central Hatchery's 4,000 rooms are showing exactly 27 minutes past 2.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,360
You are listening to the voice of the Director of the London Hatcheries

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,160
as he addresses laboratory operatives in training.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,480
My name is Holmholtz Watson and I am speaking to you from the year 2116.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,800
You are all dead. Western civilization has won wars that left it morally bankrupt.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,680
Children are no longer born, they are grown in glass vessels.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,160
Their development interrupted so they'll fit into a ruthless caste system.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:08,360
Sex is everywhere, is for recreation not procreation, and sits alongside obstacle golf

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,080
as one of the essentials of a contented, emotionally retarded existence.

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,920
Women are judged by their beauty and pneumatic performance in bed,

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,840
their faces covered in orange colorant and eyebrows painted on.

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,920
Fate continues throwing up those of us whose unfinished minds put us at odds with society.

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,000
My friend Bernard Marks discovered that the Director of the London Bracket's Human Hatcheries,

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,560
who you just heard, tried to murder his lover and her illegal unborn child in New Mexico 20 years

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,440
ago. Bernard has brought mother and grown-up son back to London. The boy, John, is now a noble,

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:57,320
upright, clear-eyed savage. Bernard plans to use John as a weapon against the Director,

21
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,960
and so prevent himself from being banished for his unconventional thinking.

22
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,480
Efficiency, that is what provides the great certainty which guides our lives and makes us

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:14,680
happy. We are, above all things, efficient in this hive of industry filled with the buzz of work.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,480
Everyone is busy, everything is in ordered motion. Under the microscopes, their long tails

25
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,800
furiously lashing, spermatozoa are burrowing headfirst into eggs. Fertilized eggs are

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,240
expanding, dividing, budding and breaking into whole populations of identical human beings.

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,920
From the social predestination room, the escalators rumble down into our basement,

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:46,280
where the eggs stew in blood surrogate and hormones. The clocks are right, everyone has a place,

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,400
and everyone stays at their allotted station in life.

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,000
Good morning, Director.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
Good morning, Mr. Marx.

32
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
Good morning, everyone.

33
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,520
You sent a message for me to meet you here, Director.

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,240
I understand you returned from your holiday in New Mexico last night.

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,520
Yes. Is this convenient? I see you're teaching.

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,920
Oh, not only convenient, Mr. Marx. Essential, I would have said. Ladies and gentlemen,

37
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,520
and those of you working at the benches, would you mind paying attention for a moment?

38
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm afraid I have a painful duty to perform. This man who stands before you,

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,840
this Alpha Plus named Bernard Marx, this colleague of yours, now an ex-colleague,

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,080
has grossly betrayed the trust invested in him. His heretical views on sport and SOMA,

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,280
the scandalous unorthodoxy of his near monogamous sex life,

42
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,920
these and other transgressions have proved him to be an enemy of order, stability,

43
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,640
and, I'm afraid I have to say, civilization itself.

44
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:58,680
I have determined to transfer you, Mr. Marx, to the most isolated hatchery we manage in Iceland.

45
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,720
Now, before you clear your locker, can you think of any reason why I shouldn't do this?

46
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,040
Yes, I can.

47
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,200
Oh, then please share it with us.

48
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,880
Certainly. But it's outside in the passage. One moment.

49
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,200
Come in. Don't worry, everything's fine. In you come.

50
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,600
There he is, Linda. Do you recognize him?

51
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,440
Well, I know you, Thomas. I would have recognized you among a thousand people.

52
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:41,880
But perhaps you've forgotten who I am. Don't you remember, Thomas? You're Linda.

53
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,160
Won't you take me in your arms, Thomas?

54
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,680
What's the meaning of this? Why have you brought this fat monster here? Is she sick?

55
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,120
What are you trying to do, Mr. Marx?

56
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,640
Would you say hello? Be kind. Hold me.

57
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,520
Oh, get off! Get off me!

58
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,200
But I'm Linda. I'm Linda. You made me have a baby.

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,040
Get away from me! I've never seen you before!

60
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,000
Wasn't my fault, Thomas. I always did my drill, didn't I? Didn't I?

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,960
Get...

62
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,440
Didn't I, you scum? I don't know how you managed to get me pregnant, but you did.

63
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,400
Stand back.

64
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:17,720
It has been awful. But our son has been a great comfort to me all the same. John? John?

65
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,400
You are my father.

66
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,040
My father?

67
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,840
I don't know what you're playing at, Mr. Marx. I have no idea who these people are.

68
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,440
This is not my son. I do not have a son.

69
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,000
This is some plot you've cooked up to save your skin. Isn't it, Mr. Marx?

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,480
Bernard's plan worked perfectly. He had humiliated the director of the London hatcheries

71
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,320
and saved his own bacon in the process. But this wasn't the only opportunity Bernard spotted.

72
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,000
John the Savage was a ticket to a new future for the diminutive Bernard.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He could become the young man's keeper, agent, manager.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,080
Having already used the scandal of Linda's pregnancy and attempted murder

75
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,760
to make contact with Mustafa Mond, the resident world controller of Western Europe,

76
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,920
he now had the ear of the most powerful man in England.

77
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,240
What couldn't he achieve if he set his mind to it?

78
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:20,840
But Linda was a complication. Taken out of the dry New Mexican climate, she quickly deteriorated.

79
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,440
We're giving her Soma instead of Mezcal. She's taking as much as 20 grams a day.

80
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,440
What's going to happen to her, Dr. Shaw?

81
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,320
Well, that dosage will finish her off in a month or two.

82
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,640
One day the respiratory centre will be paralysed. No more breathing. Finished.

83
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,040
And a good thing, too. If we could rejuvenate her, it would be different, but she's too far gone.

84
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,280
But, Doctor, why are you giving her Soma if it's shortening her life?

85
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,800
She has no serious occupation, Mr. Marx. No contribution to make.

86
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,760
So, which is better? Keeping her sober and miserable,

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,840
or giving her a few weeks of dreamscape holiday?

88
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,640
It's not right.

89
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,920
Well, first of all, it's not for you to say.

90
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,600
Unless you have a degree in clinical medicine secreted about your person. Do you?

91
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I thought not.

92
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:11,480
Linda is a scientific resource. She's a specimen we must study. We don't get her kind anymore.

93
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:17,240
It's true we can't rejuvenate her, but I, for one, I'm very glad to have this opportunity to

94
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,880
see an example of senility in a human being. Thank you so much for calling me in.

95
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,640
Now, please, leave her to us, Mr. Marx.

96
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Bernard's companion, Lenina Crown, was still reeling from her trip to New Mexico

97
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,640
and its vision of a different society that prized fidelity,

98
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,760
and in which babies were born from their mother's womb.

99
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,240
She was confused. Her particular intelligence

100
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,640
soaked up new possibilities while it went to war with her conditioning.

101
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,920
Bernard says I can meet your savage next Wednesday. I assume that's okay?

102
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,320
Why wouldn't it be? Can you pass me that serum?

103
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,520
Well, you've been a bit touchy.

104
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,760
I weren't your friend. I'd say possessive.

105
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,520
Why would I be possessive about John?

106
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,200
I had to have sex with Bernard in order to fix up the meeting with the savage.

107
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,720
Well, I'm glad, Fanny.

108
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,880
Maybe now you'll admit you were wrong about Bernard.

109
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,800
I suppose so. Once he actually had me, I realized he's all right.

110
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,280
He's quite a girl-getter, isn't he?

111
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,480
Well, he didn't used to be. In fact, that's why I liked him.

112
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,920
But everybody wants to meet him now.

113
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,520
Bernard's got invitations from the director of predestination,

114
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,400
three assistant fertilizer generals, professors at the College of Emotional Engineering,

115
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,960
the dean of Westminster Community Choir, and the list goes on and on.

116
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,560
But what exactly does he do?

117
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,120
Bernard?

118
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,320
John the savage.

119
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,640
Well, he doesn't have sex with people for a start.

120
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,480
What? Why on earth not?

121
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,240
Perhaps that's why everyone is so drawn to him.

122
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,800
He just won't do it, refuses, saving himself or something.

123
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,480
I mean, what does he do at these sessions, performances?

124
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,280
John gives a sort of improvised lecture.

125
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,800
He reads poetry, recites Shakespeare, spouts some unintelligible philosophy

126
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,440
about abstinence and monks who once lived in caves.

127
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,840
I mean, none of it adds up, but the audience like it.

128
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,400
At one moment, they're won over by his innocence,

129
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,560
and the next they're laughing at his crudity.

130
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,320
Lenina, you like him, don't you?

131
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,800
John?

132
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,920
Of course, John.

133
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,040
I'd rather say I'm intrigued by him.

134
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,680
Those blue eyes.

135
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,960
What about them?

136
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,880
Well, it's as if they see a different world to us.

137
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,960
Does that make sense?

138
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,600
Not at all.

139
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,240
Then you seem to make sense less and less, but I'm getting used to it.

140
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,520
So this is very curious, I think you'll agree.

141
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,680
Bernard, my renegade partner in crime, was changing, or being changed,

142
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,680
because for the first time in his life, he felt in control of something.

143
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,520
It was going to his head.

144
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:54,920
On the other hand, Lenina Crown, former pneumatic queen of the prone position,

145
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,680
was beginning to metamorphose.

146
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,520
But into what?

147
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,040
You know, you don't need my permission to go with Bernard.

148
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Everyone owns everyone else.

149
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,880
Well, I just thought, you know, some of his unorthodox ways might have rubbed off.

150
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,440
Bernard has become something of a catch, and I admit I liked him very much for a while.

151
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,200
But he looks fake alongside John.

152
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,640
Anyway, Bernard doesn't seem that interested in me anymore.

153
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,720
London is certainly taking notice of him.

154
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,960
Bernard had six different girls last week,

155
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,080
and there were at least another dozen practically banging the door down.

156
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't really think I want to know about all that.

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,400
Thank you.

158
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,760
I believe you envy me, don't you, Helmuth?

159
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,280
I'm rather sad for you, actually.

160
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,160
Why?

161
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,200
You don't seem to need a proper job anymore.

162
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,040
That's not something to be sad about.

163
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,280
You're rid of the director of the London Hatcheries.

164
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,160
Phew, eh?

165
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,240
Success has gone to your head.

166
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,360
That's unkind.

167
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,640
Look what's happened to you, Bernard.

168
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,800
The system is sucking you in.

169
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,120
You like having all the girls you want, and you're not watching your back anymore,

170
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,280
which is a mistake.

171
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,600
What?

172
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,200
Fundamentally, John the Savage stands for everything society hates,

173
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,680
but everyone is fascinated by his novelty.

174
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,600
He's sexy, but won't have sex.

175
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,640
But what's certain is one day, quite suddenly, that's all going to change.

176
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,240
The world order requires John's novelty should wear off,

177
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,800
and when that happens, you'll be left up the veritable creek without a paddle.

178
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
Why shouldn't I just enjoy it?

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,320
Well, I suppose, if I'm truthful.

180
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,480
I just feel deeply sorry at the way you're suddenly reconciled with a world

181
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,320
which up until now you've found revolting.

182
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,040
Wrong again.

183
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,880
I'm no friend of the world order.

184
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,720
I've heard that's a different tone in your voice.

185
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,040
What?

186
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,640
You aren't blustering as much.

187
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,480
You don't seem threatened.

188
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,400
You've become part of the system.

189
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,360
Your wisdom makes for poignant but unthreatening broadcasting.

190
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,880
Your newly acquired privilege guts you of authenticity.

191
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,760
You're being cruel.

192
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,000
Your status flows from John the Savage.

193
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,880
When his novelty wears off, you'll be left exposed.

194
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,840
He'll be cast out and the same will happen to you.

195
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,200
Look up, John.

196
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,880
What is it?

197
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't you think that's impressive?

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,880
It's a captive weather balloon hanging there like a pearl in the sky.

199
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,920
You sound proud.

200
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,200
Why shouldn't I be?

201
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,320
It's nothing to do with you.

202
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,160
You don't own it.

203
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,360
You didn't make it.

204
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,120
You didn't decide it was needed.

205
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,800
I agree, it's a good thing.

206
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,760
But why would you take credit for it being there?

207
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,480
I'm not taking credit for it.

208
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,240
Just now you were all puffed up.

209
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,120
Against my instincts, I sometimes feel, well, yes, proud is the right word.

210
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,960
Proud of what human beings can achieve.

211
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,200
An Indian wise woman told me about something she read as a child.

212
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,280
The writer's name was Emerson.

213
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,840
He spoke of people bound together by a shared human soul, the oversoul.

214
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,480
There's one thing in our godforsaken world I agree with

215
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
and it's the abolition of superstition.

216
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,440
You've just said it.

217
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,080
Said what?

218
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,040
Godforsaken.

219
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,360
Yes, it might look that way.

220
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,440
But God's own son died on the cross to save us from our sins.

221
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,680
God has not forsaken us.

222
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,920
And perhaps it's time for another sacrifice to save mankind.

223
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,480
I believe in what I can see and touch.

224
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,640
Just now you were proud of the human race.

225
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,160
Don't worry, it didn't last long.

226
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,200
I'm over it now.

227
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,840
You felt in communion with your fellow creatures.

228
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,120
What is it?

229
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,880
That's the Bombay Green Rocket.

230
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,680
It flies at 1,250 kilometres an hour.

231
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,720
What do you think of that?

232
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,080
What should I think of it?

233
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,240
I don't know.

234
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,640
I suppose you should be impressed.

235
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,240
You see, you can't help yourself, can you?

236
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,600
Compared to Mustapha Mond's status, power and aura of danger,

237
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,080
Bernard Marx is an ant.

238
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,760
Why did Mond answer the telephone to Bernard

239
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,360
when he called from New Mexico with news of the director of Hatchery's crime?

240
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,640
Mond must have spotted something he'd want to keep close, to hold tight.

241
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,600
And he maintained regular contact with Bernard through these weeks and months.

242
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,400
You see, sir, the Savage shows surprisingly little astonishment at,

243
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
or awe of, civilised inventions.

244
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,120
This is partly due, no doubt, to the fact he has heard them talked about

245
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,840
disparagingly by the woman Linda, his mother.

246
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,040
I wish you hadn't felt you needed to use that word.

247
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,400
He remains steadfastly concerned with something he calls the human soul,

248
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,320
which he persists in regarding as an entity independent of the physical environment.

249
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,360
I always assumed ferals would be frightening.

250
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,200
I had not anticipated your John would be a confused idiot.

251
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,320
I don't think he's an idiot.

252
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,000
He says he finds the infantile, civilised world unsatisfying.

253
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,120
He believes we have diminished the qualities that make us human.

254
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,280
I'm not sure I understand you.

255
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,840
I was trying to point out that...

256
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,240
You seem to be under the misapprehension.

257
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,520
We are engaged in some sort of debate, you and I.

258
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,320
What? I thought...

259
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,320
That we agree, all subjects, including the hard-won happiness of the civilised peoples of the earth,

260
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:07,480
the close-order organisation of humanity by intelligence, talent and usefulness,

261
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,480
the abandonment of emotion as a factor in relationships,

262
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,800
that all these achievements are somehow open to scrutiny.

263
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
I am very sorry if I have caused offence.

264
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,200
Not at all, Mr. Marx.

265
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,920
You're not important enough to cause offence.

266
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,480
There is no offence here.

267
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,640
There is only what will prevail and what won't.

268
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,760
Have I made myself plain?

269
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,640
Yes, sir.

270
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,520
You are my spy, Mr. Marx.

271
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,360
My creature.

272
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,280
I expect you to continue reporting every day.

273
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:49,240
Welcome to the factory, Mr. Savage.

274
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,760
That's not my name.

275
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,640
I'm sorry? Not Mr. John Savage, then?

276
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,680
It is a name others have applied without asking my opinion.

277
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,920
Please, simply call me John.

278
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,240
Each process in the factory is carried out as far as possible by a single group of what we call twins.

279
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,360
We use the word not because they come in pairs, but to represent their identical genetic make-up.

280
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,160
The official title is a Bokanovsky group,

281
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,560
named after the scientific pioneer who invented the process of their fertilisation.

282
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:24,760
You will see 83 black Bokanovskys with broad, short skulls, practically noseless.

283
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,080
Then deltas, taking care of cold pressing.

284
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,320
56 spindle chuckers, working on machines manipulated by 57 aquiline-featured, ginger-haired gammas.

285
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,680
In the assembling rooms, the dynamos are being put together by two sets of gamma-plus dwarfs.

286
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,880
Oh, brave new world.

287
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,080
Pardon, Mr. Savage.

288
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,560
Oh, brave new world that has such people in it.

289
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,720
Mr. John, I assure you, Mr. Savage, we hardly have any trouble with our workers.

290
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,200
We tend to find...

291
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,000
I've heard enough.

292
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,040
Where are you going?

293
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,000
I have the courtesy tour all set up and the refreshments.

294
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,880
Please, where's the nearest restroom? I'm going to be sick.

295
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,240
Voice message to Mustafa Mond.

296
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,280
Personal voice account.

297
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,320
Security level two.

298
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,680
Daily report.

299
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,440
The Savage refuses to take soma himself and seems much distressed because the woman,

300
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,360
Linda, his M, remains permanently on a soma holiday.

301
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:20,760
It's interesting that in spite of his M's senility and the extreme repulsiveness of her appearance,

302
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,880
the Savage frequently goes to see her and appears to be much attached to her.

303
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,960
This is an interesting example of the way early conditioning can be made to modify

304
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,760
and even run counter to natural impulses.

305
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,160
In this case, the impulse to recoil from an unpleasant object.

306
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,720
Our society shares something very profound with those that have gone before.

307
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,360
It is always necessary to educate a small slice of society to a much higher level than the rest.

308
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,520
We need logical, trained, but creative minds at the helm.

309
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
This carries a risk.

310
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:01,080
I, and to a degree Bernard as well, we're examples of what can go wrong.

311
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,640
Train a mind to be inventive in a crisis and you risk that a minority will go rogue.

312
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:15,800
That minority will be solitary, weep for the human condition and travel in a mist of melancholia.

313
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,960
Good afternoon, Mr. Savage, Mr. Marks.

314
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,560
Good afternoon, Miss Keats.

315
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,000
Please, my name is not John Savage.

316
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,600
It is simply John.

317
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,320
I see.

318
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,000
Please don't take offense, Miss Keats.

319
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,440
Thank you for welcoming us to Eton Upper School.

320
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,320
Mr. Marks, it is only correct this school of schools should celebrate the arrival of

321
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,880
such a distinguished stranger in our midst for the purposes of learning about ourselves.

322
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,000
It is easy to forget how modern society overcame the past

323
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,920
and if we are to relish the present, we must see the past for what it was.

324
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,800
And here is the blue-eyed, living and breathing past.

325
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,600
Do you have many what you call twins here?

326
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,560
Oh, no.

327
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,440
Eton Upper School is reserved exclusively for the decision makers of the future.

328
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,840
Upper caste boys and girls.

329
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,520
One unique egg, one unique adult.

330
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,320
It makes educating them much more difficult, of course,

331
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,280
but as they'll be called upon to take huge responsibilities

332
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,560
and deal with unexpected emergencies, it cannot be helped.

333
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,640
Miss Keats, if you're free any Monday, Wednesday or Friday evening,

334
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,040
I would love the opportunity to talk to you about how I discovered John.

335
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Thank you. I would like that.

336
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:35,880
You have an impish intellectual quality about you which I find very attractive, Mr. Marks.

337
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,400
Will Mr. Savage be available too?

338
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,720
Yeah, that's unlikely, Miss Keats.

339
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,640
Really? You'll have to explain that to me later, Mr. Marks.

340
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,680
Now, I'm going to take you straight to an Alpha Plus classroom

341
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,320
and show you a class in Malthusian drill first-hand.

342
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,520
After that, we'll go to a geography lesson about beta minus reservations,

343
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,240
such as the one you're familiar with, Mr. Savage.

344
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,840
John, not Savage.

345
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,120
And how do you choose where to put a reservation?

346
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,360
Well, I don't choose. I don't have anything to do with reservations.

347
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,720
Well, how do they choose, the other people?

348
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,480
Reservations are in locations characterized by unfavorable climatic or geological conditions

349
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,400
or poverty of natural resources.

350
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,040
Places just not worth civilizing.

351
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,880
Where the conditions are cruel.

352
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,200
Do your students read Shakespeare?

353
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,160
Certainly not.

354
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,120
Ah, they're coming back from a trip.

355
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,200
Where have these pupils been, Miss Keats?

356
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,320
Slough crematorium.

357
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,280
Every pupil here spends two mornings a week in a hospital for the dying.

358
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,920
They get chocolate ice cream if they see a death.

359
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,280
They learn it's good that old people die to make way for the young.

360
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,880
When do you start them on soma?

361
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,760
It's one of those insoluble conundrums.

362
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,080
Most youngsters are taking small doses of soma in the afternoons at nursery.

363
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,680
But we all know soma has a negative effect on brain development.

364
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,000
Of course, that doesn't matter as a general rule.

365
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,640
But our boys and girls are special.

366
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,760
We hold off on soma until physical development has done most of the work by itself.

367
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,280
Around the age of 14 years.

368
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,840
Now, if you'll follow me, please.

369
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:17,960
I've left my hairspray in the apartment.

370
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,000
Can I borrow yours?

371
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,360
I've stopped using the stuff.

372
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,640
I'll have to borrow Cindy's.

373
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm sure she won't mind.

374
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,480
Lenina, you're looking very pleased with yourself.

375
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,400
That's because I am.

376
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,760
Bernard has a meeting tonight and he's asked me to take John to the immersive cinema.

377
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,360
I'll have to hurry if I'm going to be on time.

378
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,160
What's he like?

379
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,680
In truth, far too thoughtful.

380
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,720
It's quite disconcerting.

381
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
No, what's he like in bed?

382
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,080
I wouldn't know, Fanny.

383
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,800
You're joking.

384
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,480
Surely you don't mean that you...

385
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,280
Look, it's wonderful soaking up the attention that comes from being with Bernard and John Savage,

386
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,480
but there hasn't been anything physical between John and I.

387
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,240
The first thing everyone wants to know is what's it like to make love to a savage.

388
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,920
And I have to say, I don't know.

389
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,600
Frankly, that's a bit of a shock.

390
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,160
Fanny, he's terribly good looking and everything, but...

391
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,020
Will I...

392
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,140
Say it.

393
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm going to take a risk and confide in you.

394
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,500
Go ahead.

395
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,480
I listened to Bernard.

396
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,560
A lot of the things he said early on about wanting to have a relationship with just one person

397
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,840
and explore that, well, that's got inside my head.

398
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,840
I wanted to be with Bernard, but he's changed since John turned up.

399
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,160
He doesn't seem quite as different, quite as endearing as he did,

400
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,240
not quite as brave sort of thing.

401
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,400
And you're not making sense.

402
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,120
I mean, I don't simply want to jump on top of John Savage.

403
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,960
I would like to do it with John now, yes, but properly, as part of a relationship.

404
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,280
So doesn't he like you?

405
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,680
Sometimes I think he does and sometimes I think he doesn't.

406
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,080
Sometimes he seems to do his best to avoid me.

407
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,880
Goes out of the room when I come in, won't touch me, won't even look at me.

408
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,040
But sometimes if I turn around, suddenly I catch him staring and I can see he definitely does like me.

409
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,400
I'd be confused too.

410
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Don't tell anyone.

411
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,480
Of course not.

412
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,600
I don't pretend to be able to keep up with the twists and turns of your alternative lifestyle.

413
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,440
Fanny, the truth is I like John quite a lot.

414
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,000
More than I think is normal.

415
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,240
I don't want you at home tonight.

416
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,920
No problem.

417
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,520
I'll pick someone else up, no doubt.

418
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,800
Later that same night...

419
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:25,640
The technical term for which is an ellipsis.

420
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,680
Is there something wrong?

421
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,520
Didn't you enjoy the film?

422
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,680
No, I didn't.

423
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,600
Well, I thought it might get you in the mood.

424
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,560
Was it because of the people staring at you?

425
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,000
No, I'm used to that now.

426
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,560
Well, what then?

427
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,080
What have I done wrong?

428
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,560
I don't think you should watch things like that.

429
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,960
Things like what, John?

430
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
Well, that woman.

431
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,920
She was trying to get away from all those bad men.

432
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,400
Then they caught her and they all ravished her.

433
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,000
Yes, but she enjoyed it.

434
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,120
Not to begin with.

435
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,840
But she realised how good it is that all those men wanted her.

436
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,040
But the girl acting...

437
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,480
Most people would say she's lucky.

438
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,680
Is that what you really think?

439
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,200
I don't understand.

440
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,800
I was watching her face.

441
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,960
She was pretending to like it.

442
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,320
Pretending that each man made her more and more happy.

443
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,800
She gasped and whimpered and trashed around as if they were driving her into a frenzy.

444
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,560
But that wasn't what I saw in her eyes.

445
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,240
What did you see, John?

446
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,760
Loneliness.

447
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,040
Fear.

448
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,200
Indeed, sadness deep down in the pools of her watery eyes.

449
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,320
What they did to her was horrible.

450
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,160
Can you really not see that?

451
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,080
John, it was lovely.

452
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,160
No, it was base and ignoble.

453
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,240
And it makes me feel dirty because I watched it.

454
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,440
I don't know what you mean.

455
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,520
Why do you go out of your way to spoil things?

456
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,120
No, I don't.

457
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,240
It's just that everything is around the wrong way.

458
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,560
The world has turned backwards on itself.

459
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,240
There's no substance to anything.

460
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,200
Everything is made to wither the instant someone buys it.

461
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,680
And so you have to buy more of whatever it is.

462
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,160
And permanence, ideas, they've become dirty words when they should be virtues.

463
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,240
Look, John.

464
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,240
You're terribly good looking.

465
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,640
Do you want to take my clothes off or shall I do it for you?

466
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,600
You'd rather I do it myself, would you?

467
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,760
Do please say something.

468
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Please don't take your clothes off, Lenina.

469
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,320
But John...

470
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,480
I have an important speaking engagement tomorrow.

471
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,040
At least Bernard says it's important.

472
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,280
I'm exhausted.

473
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,560
I have to get some sleep.

474
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,400
Take a couple of grams of Soma and we'll just go to bed.

475
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,800
I'll lie next to you with a sheet between us.

476
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,320
That's all I want.

477
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,560
I always thought it would be the likes of Mustafa Mond who'd end John's celebrity

478
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,400
and Bernard's by default.

479
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,680
I never thought John would reach breaking point first.

480
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,520
That it would be his idealism, if you can call it that,

481
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,280
his sense of right and wrong, what matters and what doesn't,

482
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,960
that would kill the golden goose.

483
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,760
You can't do this, John.

484
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,240
There's a huge crowd waiting for you.

485
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,760
They're wasting their time.

486
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,260
Listen.

487
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,200
All these people have been invited for the specific purpose of meeting you.

488
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,480
They want to hear you speak.

489
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,920
From now on, you must ask me first before you make arrangements like this.

490
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,800
I'm managing you.

491
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,640
I find the opportunities and set them up and you turn up and do your act.

492
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,140
Act?

493
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,440
You've hit the nail on the head.

494
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,200
That's precisely why I don't want to do it.

495
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,360
I went through all this yesterday evening.

496
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,760
I think maybe I shan't do my act ever again.

497
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,560
Do you really mean that?

498
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:31,880
Yes.

499
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,400
Then what am I supposed to do?

500
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,040
What do you mean?

501
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,400
Everything you've got now.

502
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,960
All the fame, the adulation, the money.

503
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,240
I did that all for you.

504
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,560
We're a team and now I'm reliant on us staying that way.

505
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,200
My entire quality of life depends on it.

506
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,400
Listen to yourself.

507
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,880
You are disgusting.

508
00:26:49,880 --> 00:27:04,520
Thank you all very much for coming along tonight.

509
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,800
John is very honoured by this turnout of London's most important and dynamic minds.

510
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:18,120
I am sorry to tell you that John is rather overcome.

511
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,360
It is only one month since his arrival in civilisation.

512
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,640
It has been a shock to his mind and physiology.

513
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,760
We need all to understand he is a human being, albeit a primitive one.

514
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,560
His senses are overwhelmed and we think it best if tonight's reception is postponed.

515
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:44,040
I thank you all for your kindness and look forward to receiving your responses to reissued invitations.

516
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,960
Mr. Marks.

517
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,440
Yes, Miss Keats.

518
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:55,160
I look around me and I see a gathering of the most influential non-twin high alphas in London.

519
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,800
I assume you have made the nature of his audience plain to Mr. Savage.

520
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,880
Yes, indeed I have, Miss Keats.

521
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,400
You and I have a physical understanding.

522
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,720
Half the people here attended my school and everyone here deserves respect.

523
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,880
And if I may say so, Mr. Marks, to be feared.

524
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,480
As I said, Miss Keats, Mr. Savage and I are very well aware of the status of this evening's guests.

525
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,880
I'm afraid I have to wrap things up now.

526
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,240
Good night.

527
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,200
Sorry.

528
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,320
Sorry.

529
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:27,820
Sorry.

530
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,540
[Door slams]

531
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:37,100
Bernard, what's happened?

532
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,460
Lenina.

533
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,020
Where's John?

534
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,460
John locked himself in a cloakroom.

535
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,300
I expect he's scarpered by now.

536
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:44,940
Oh, where to?

537
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,580
Who knows?

538
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,540
Who knows what goes through that savage mind, if anything.

539
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,900
Oh, he knew I'd be here.

540
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,740
Perhaps it's because he doesn't like me.

541
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,260
Don't be sad, Lenina.

542
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,780
Hey, where did you come from?

543
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,140
I came home early this morning, long before I had to leave for work,

544
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,860
hoping I'd catch a look at John Savage's starkers.

545
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,620
But he'd already gone, hadn't he?

546
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,780
You wouldn't say what happened last night.

547
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,540
When you left today, you had a strange air about you.

548
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,580
I was concerned.

549
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,860
Are you a charlatan, Mr. Marks?

550
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,420
Pardon?

551
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,500
This whole John Savage fable has been very good for you, hasn't it?

552
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,540
Well, lots of women have gone with you who wouldn't otherwise have done.

553
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,140
John Savage is your own personal performing animal.

554
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,420
Roll up, roll up, watch the savage dance.

555
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,140
What?

556
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,540
I know someone who knows someone who was working in the embryo store at the time you were grown.

557
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,020
She said it's absolutely true about alcohol getting into your renal feed by mistake.

558
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,180
You're not even a real alpha, are you?

559
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:47,900
So, John, you found your way back.

560
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:53,340
I can smell it.

561
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,940
What can you smell?

562
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,980
Lelini's perfume.

563
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,900
So you've been with her.

564
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,940
And where have you been?

565
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,780
Hiding.

566
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,620
It's over for me.

567
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,020
I've fallen off my pedestal.

568
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,060
It was never very secure.

569
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,220
I mean, it was not a wise course for you to take up.

570
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,260
So you made love.

571
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,020
How was it?

572
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,020
We didn't do what you mean.

573
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,060
We're just together.

574
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,780
That's all.

575
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,420
If you're waiting for her to fall in love with you, don't.

576
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,740
No one does that anymore.

577
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,740
It's not on the approved list of emotions.

578
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,780
There's a message on your machine.

579
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,780
Your friend Helm holds.

580
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:36,780
I wanted to talk to you because I am so very excited.

581
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,740
You're Mr Savage, who isn't a savage at all.

582
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,300
I saw a video feed of him at some event you took him to.

583
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,060
He was reading poetry.

584
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:51,020
He gave a celebration of passion, solitude, loyalty, indeed love even.

585
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,100
He's very inspiring.

586
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,900
I feel as though I'm beginning to have something to write about.

587
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,300
I want to meet your savage.

588
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,060
I like that word, by the way.

589
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,980
We use it to deny people's validity.

590
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,500
I think we should reacquire it, celebrate it, be savage.

591
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,100
Although I don't know for the life of me what form that would take.

592
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,380
Anyway, please let me meet him.

593
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,740
Anytime will suit.

594
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,940
I'll make myself available.

595
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,080
Bye.

596
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,620
Would you meet him?

597
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,000
Why not?

598
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,780
You wouldn't run away and hide like you did today.

599
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,540
It depends what he's like.

600
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,780
I mean, I'm not your pet and I have stopped acting like one.

601
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:36,380
Lenina, please wait.

602
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,300
Henry, long time no see.

603
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:40,800
Hello.

604
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,620
How have you been?

605
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,120
Not bad.

606
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,100
Would you like to come to a film tonight?

607
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,860
No, thank you.

608
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,780
So, are you going out with Harry Benito then?

609
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,300
No.

610
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,740
Is there something wrong?

611
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,100
You're not ill, are you?

612
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,740
Not brooding?

613
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,100
Shut up, you stupid man.

614
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,300
Hello, you two.

615
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,900
Making plans for tonight?

616
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,940
Apparently not.

617
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,460
Go away, Henry.

618
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,020
Certainly.

619
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,460
I'm off.

620
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,180
Bye, Fanny.

621
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:10,540
Everyone belongs to everyone else and don't you forget it.

622
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,140
What happened?

623
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,660
I just couldn't be bothered with him.

624
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,820
I could smell a man, a rather unwashed man when I got back this morning.

625
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,940
Was it Mr Savage?

626
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,000
Yes.

627
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,500
And how was he?

628
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,740
We slept with a sheep between us.

629
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,780
It was very chaste.

630
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,540
He's the one I want.

631
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,020
There are millions of other men in the world.

632
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,540
But I don't want them.

633
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,900
How do you know until you've tried?

634
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,020
I have tried.

635
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,820
But how many?

636
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,540
Dozens.

637
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,540
Well, you need to persevere.

638
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,820
While I'm thinking about him.

639
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,940
But just don't.

640
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,980
I can't help it.

641
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,060
Take as much soma as you need to forget.

642
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,780
But every time I surface from it, I shall like him all over again.

643
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:50,380
I'm disgusted with myself for saying it and please don't repeat it to anyone else.

644
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:55,500
But I think perhaps you have to take him and make him yours.

645
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,540
Just yours.

646
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,700
Find out what that's actually like.

647
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,620
Are you all right?

648
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,540
No, not at all.

649
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,420
I think what you're doing is stupid.

650
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,580
But I understand it.

651
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,820
I shouldn't, but I do.

652
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,980
I feel...

653
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,700
I used to be contented.

654
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,460
I'm going home now to soak in a bath with 100 milligrams of soma

655
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,700
and try to forget we've had this conversation.

656
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:30,060
You don't seem very pleased to see me, John.

657
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,520
Don't I?

658
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,980
Actually, I'm delighted.

659
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,380
I'm sorry if I don't look it.

660
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,140
I'm falling in love with you.

661
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,900
But it isn't working like it should.

662
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,060
It's making me a bit sad.

663
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,780
I don't know why.

664
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,740
It's mad, but I'm frightened of having you

665
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,140
because that means sooner or later I'll lose you.

666
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,340
I don't understand it either.

667
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:54,940
If any other man had refused to do it with me, I'd have been insulted.

668
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,580
You remember that in New Mexico people still get married?

669
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,140
I'd like us to be bound together like that too.

670
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,820
Do you mean it, John?

671
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,660
They make a promise to live together forever.

672
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,980
I don't know if I could.

673
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,900
I'm afraid the idea still makes me queasy.

674
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,700
Don't do that.

675
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,420
Do what?

676
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,060
Resist.

677
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,660
I can have an opinion, can't I?

678
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,380
When you say opinion, you mean being difficult and spiky.

679
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,180
We should be together like in Shakespeare.

680
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:22,380
Outliving beauties outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays.

681
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,660
I don't understand that.

682
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,940
I love you more than anything else in the world.

683
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:34,700
So, this is finally happening, is it?

684
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,100
Help me with my zip.

685
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,380
But, Lenina...

686
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,420

I want to know the extremes of emotion, of pain, regret, thwarted ambition, lost love.

869
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,360
I want them all first hand.

870
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,960
Hear what he just said.

871
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,640
He wants to become a human being.

872
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,880
Don't you lot want that as well?

873
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,440
All right.

874
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,240
All right, you two.

875
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,280
You've had your fun.

876
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,840
Well done.

877
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,200
Everyone's got the message.

878
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,320
Time to go.

879
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,240
We need to get out of here.

880
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,240
This is an illegal gathering.

881
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,200
You are hereby given notice your usual rights as citizens are suspended.

882
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,040
Everyone is required to lie down to be handcuffed.

883
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,240
Doma Stinger will be administered.

884
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,480
Doma Stinger will be administered.

885
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:22,980
Helmholtz.

886
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,280
John, you madman.

887
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,400
We have to get away.

888
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,540
Now!

889
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,080
You were told to stand still.

890
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,580
Run.

891
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,940
Run!

892
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,440
I can't see.

893
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,160
I can't...

894
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,040
I can't see.

895
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,240
You were wrong.

896
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,400
You Alphas, you don't get it, do you?

897
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,200
See this?

898
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,080
I'll stripe you across the face with it if you move again.

899
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,800
This, this here in my hand, this is the truth.

900
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,240
And don't you forget it.

901
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,000
My friends!

902
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,680
Friends!

903
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,120
Please, calm down.

904
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,160
Everyone has the right to an opinion.

905
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,400
But remember, everyone also belongs to everyone else.

906
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,360
You've had your chance at the free will.

907
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,480
And time's up.

908
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,840
You will all be transported to an emergency reconditioning centre

909
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,240
and released when the doctors feel you're ready.

910
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,360
The police didn't do exactly what they said they would.

911
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,560
The public were taken away for re-indoctrination.

912
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,480
The three of us were transferred to an hotel

913
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,920
where we were watched while we showered and dressed in clothes provided.

914
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,680
Those dreadful rayon clothes with zippers that are so depressingly uniform.

915
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,360
We were then transferred by luxury vehicle to the office of Mustafa Mond,

916
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,480
500 feet above the streets of Westminster.

917
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,200
So you don't much like civilisation, Mr Savage?

918
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,360
Savage is not my name.

919
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,560
Can we move beyond matters of administration?

920
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,800
It's not a matter of administration.

921
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,840
It's a matter of my name.

922
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,320
John, shh!

923
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,000
My name is who I am.

924
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,720
And no, I don't much like your civilisation, Mr Mond.

925
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,720
That's very disappointing.

926
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,400
Surely there's something you like?

927
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,600
There's a lot of music.

928
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,880
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about my ears

929
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,720
and sometimes voices.

930
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,160
You've read it too?

931
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,880
I thought nobody knew that book in England.

932
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,360
It's prohibited to all but the select few.

933
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,240
The children you met at Eton Upper School.

934
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,280
Miss Keats said they didn't teach it.

935
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,800
She lied.

936
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,560
The ideas.

937
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,880
The way of seeing it encourages...

938
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,600
It's very dangerous.

939
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,160
Only for the trusted few.

940
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,120
That was always the case with art before we became properly civilised.

941
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,600
Oh, 100 years ago some people pretended it was for the hurt

942
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,800
but they still kept it mostly to themselves.

943
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,520
Anyway, no one's officially allowed it.

944
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,160
It's prohibited by law.

945
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,240
But as I make the law, I can speak it out loud.

946
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,640
You, on the other hand, do not make the law.

947
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,400
And so can't...

948
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,680
But why prohibit it?

949
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,560
Mr Watson, have you forgotten your teacher training?

950
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,200
Your rules of intellectual exclusion?

951
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,720
You are an employee of an academic institution

952
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,160
and within that world, if you want to remain employed

953
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,360
it is required that you do as you are told

954
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,360
while maintaining the facade of free thinking.

955
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:32,880
But free thinking must not actually intrude, must it?

956
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,840
That's the iron truth behind the rayon fist.

957
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,160
Even if the words are simply beautiful.

958
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,560
I have observed myself.

959
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,200
I know that I think in words

960
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,520
and the words I have and don't have determine the boundaries of my thought.

961
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,240
I want beautiful words because I want more chances to think new thoughts

962
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,200
to make new combinations and get new answers.

963
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,320
We are talking about old words.

964
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,520
We don't have any use for old things here

965
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,200
particularly when they're beautiful.

966
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,040
The Chinese got it right back in the early 21st century.

967
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,920
If only we'd taken notice of them sooner.

968
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,160
Harmony, they called it.

969
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,640
And it was all smiles.

970
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,800
Thankfully, we saved ourselves eventually.

971
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,000
Excuse me, Comptroller.

972
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,200
Oh, you've found your courage at last, Mr Marks.

973
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,720
Not really, but I wanted to ask.

974
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,520
What would be wrong with making that book Shakespeare commonly available?

975
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,840
People could make up their own minds whether or not to read it.

976
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,920
It would be a waste of resources.

977
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,720
Why?

978
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,960
Because it would not make a profit.

979
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,340
Reading?

980
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,360
No one does it voluntarily anymore.

981
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,800
There's too much else to do for which one has to pay.

982
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,040
If you don't have to pay, it can't be worth anything.

983
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,080
And paying is what keeps the world turning.

984
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,680
And anyway, they would not understand those words now.

985
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,040
They'd regard them as obscure, boring, stupid.

986
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,160
All right, then.

987
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:04,960
Here's a question.

988
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,920
Why do you make the stupid ones at all?

989
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,560
The gammas, deltas, and epsilons?

990
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,640
Why don't you make everyone an alpha double plus?

991
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,840
Because we have no wish to have our throats cut.

992
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:21,920
A society of alphas couldn't fail to be unstable and miserable.

993
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,200
An alpha-conditioned human being would go mad if he had to do epsilon semi-moron work.

994
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,200
The optimum population is modelled on an iceberg.

995
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,480
Eight ninths below the waterline, one ninth above.

996
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,360
And they are happy below the waterline.

997
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,200
Deliriously so.

998
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,800
Why keep the work moronic?

999
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,880
Why not invent more labour-saving devices?

1000
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,440
Useless effort keeps them occupied and us out of danger.

1001
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,840
But we're always saying science is everything.

1002
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,000
It's in the sleek teaching of 13 to 17 year olds, three times a week.

1003
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,880
I was a pretty good scientist in my day.

1004
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,200
Then I had a revelation.

1005
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,600
I realised that all our science is just a cookery book,

1006
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,360
with an orthodox theory of cooking that nobody's allowed to question,

1007
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:15,120
and a list of recipes that must not be altered without the permission of the head cook.

1008
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,560
But I did a bit of illicit cooking.

1009
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,680
A bit of real science.

1010
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,960
What happened?

1011
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,960
Very nearly what's going to happen to you.

1012
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,920
I was nearly sent to Iceland.

1013
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,120
Are you serious?

1014
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,480
Absolutely.

1015
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,000
The thing all three of you fail to understand in your different ways

1016
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,000
is that people are animals and they need to be controlled for their own good.

1017
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,440
Some past dictatorial religions and areligious societies have understood that and acted accordingly,

1018
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,560
but they all failed because they lacked the appearance of kindness.

1019
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:59,600
The world is safe now because of the irresistible force of kindness

1020
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,480
married to rigorous suppression.

1021
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,920
And clever, educated, sometime rebels like me.

1022
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,200
We are the poachers turned gamekeepers who are best at anticipating where problems might arise.

1023
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,480
Now, go home and sort out your things.

1024
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,600
Watson, you may keep your communication device.

1025
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,960
It will be set to receive only so you can know the events that shall unravel from here.

1026
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,080
I quite admire your intellect.

1027
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,960
You remind me of me.

1028
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,360
Perhaps you might be of use someday.

1029
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:38,960
You will receive notice of your travel arrangements and don't try to stir up trouble.

1030
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,640
We shall be watching you.

1031
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,080
Oh, and John.

1032
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,880
Yes?

1033
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,320
You will be pleased to know you won't be going to Iceland.

1034
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,440
The other two will go without you.

1035
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,760
But why?

1036
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,320
Because you are too dangerous, even for Iceland.

1037
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,840
We have fenced off an area of forest in Surrey

1038
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,880
and equipped an old concrete military bunker with the basics required for civilized living.

1039
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,920
You like your religious illusions?

1040
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,760
Imagine yourself a medieval hermit.

1041
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,320
Flight paths have been changed to avoid the area.

1042
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]

1043
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:32,000
Once we were aboard the plane for Iceland, I took the opportunity to check my messages.

1044
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,560
I listened to a long, rambling speech from Bernard's girlfriend.

1045
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,680
She sounded... broken.

1046
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,920
I'm sorry I missed you, Mr. Watson.

1047
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,080
Bernard thinks a lot of you.

1048
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,520
I hoped you might be able to help me.

1049
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,920
You see, I don't know how I'm supposed to make any sense of this.

1050
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,080
Believe me, I really don't understand.

1051
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,520
Beyond which zip-up boots to wear,

1052
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,840
or which of the men at the Soma fountain to go home with,

1053
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,640
I haven't had to make a serious decision about any aspect of my life.

1054
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,440
I haven't wanted to.

1055
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,840
Now this man comes along, turns me down, sends me into a spin.

1056
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,600
It was comfortable being wanted.

1057
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,400
Please make things normal again.

1058
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,720
I want not to want.

1059
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,120
Men came and went, literally, and each brought some kind of novelty, mostly and all.

1060
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,800
Confirmed I am special, beautiful, desirable, and I depilated.

1061
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,560
And deodorized and was worshipped and stroked and complimented.

1062
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,360
Then he comes along, this downright cheek of it.

1063
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,960
And suddenly everything I thought counted for nothing.

1064
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,240
Not for him, the tinted hair, foundation, long enameled nails.

1065
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,280
Not for him, the uplift bra and gossamer pants.

1066
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,040
No, he wants everything natural.

1067
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,560
Ugly, in other words.

1068
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,240
And he wanted me thinking, not blanked by Soma and sex.

1069
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,640
And I know he's right, but he has stripped it all away.

1070
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,960
Oh, showed me how useless I am.

1071
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,240
And put nothing in its place.

1072
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,160
I am empty now.

1073
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,480
Lost, sad, and I can't stand it.

1074
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,520
I ache for him, for myself, for everything.

1075
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,960
A lost soul, and even that word makes sense because I know it should exist,

1076
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,760
but for me it doesn't.

1077
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,720
I can't stand this.

1078
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,920
How can I be expected to?

1079
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,720
There's no one who can...

1080
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:33,040
So we managed to ruin her along with ourselves.

1081
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:40,400
An uncomplicated young woman became complex under the influence of a trio of men

1082
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,840
who asked questions which had no answers.

1083
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:53,600
Unfortunately, John's personal reservation was not preserved in anonymity.

1084
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,840
Its chance discovery by a lorry driver and his son

1085
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:03,120
prompted a flurry of publicity and an invasion of suburban helicopterists.

1086
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:08,480
During the national holiday week, they descended on his bunker in swarms,

1087
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,160
always demanding the spectacle of his self-flagellation.

1088
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,920
"The whip! The whip!" they cried, and he obliged.

1089
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:23,360
Until, one day, he was discovered in the stairwell of his dark concrete abode.

1090
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,520
A headgear of gorse wound about his matted locks,

1091
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:34,160
a flow of dried blood staining his side where he'd clipped the sharp banister while dropping.

1092
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:41,200
Mr. Savage turned very slowly at the end of a fifteen-foot rope,

1093
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:48,880
his martyrdom complete, his neck broken, his coitus achieved.

1094
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,880
His feet, like two unhurried compass needles,

1095
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:02,240
turning towards the right and after a few seconds unhurriedly turning back to the left.

1096
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,720
On hearing the news of John's death,

1097
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,760
Lenina Crown walked out into the road in Kensington Gore and lay down,

1098
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,320
waiting to be flattened by a bus.

1099
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,800
Then she resided in a care home in Wembley

1100
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,320
until throwing herself from a window when the nurse's back was turned.

1101
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,560
At least, that was the story given out.

1102
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:30,640
Goodbye, Lenina Crown.

1103
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,040
Goodbye, history.

1104
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:50,800

00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,000
Everyone belongs to everyone else.

1114
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,240
Everyone belongs to everyone else.
