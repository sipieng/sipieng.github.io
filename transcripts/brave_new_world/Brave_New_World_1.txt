00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, dramatized for radio by Jonathan Holloway.

[MUSIC]

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Are you finished in the bathroom, Fanny?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, it's all yours.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, you look terrific.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of course.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I think I'm getting hairier.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Use my removal cream.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We are in a small flat occupied by two young women,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
student workers who at the end of a normal day

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
are getting themselves spruced up for the evening ahead.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Listen to their happy voices.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You would never guess what they do for a living,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
how they earn their bread,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
or how they expect to spend their leisure.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Tonight will be my 30th new man.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In how long?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Six months since January.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Very good.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I saw Erica Hite did a whole escalator squash team in public last weekend.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Gosh, you're such a show-off.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What do you mean "would have been"?

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I may just stay in.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not feeling too good.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What's the matter?

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Dr. Wells says I should have a three-month pregnancy substitute.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're only 19.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let me introduce myself.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
My name is Helmholtz Watson.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I've decided to write an account of what I now see as

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
an irretrievably corrupted humanity.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There might be a very slim chance people will return to a healthier way,

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and maybe that's why it's worth recording this.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's what I tell myself.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't hold out much hope,

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
but it is a way of perhaps preserving my own sanity just a little longer.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Writing gives a reason not just to curl up with an overdose

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
of the current neurotoxin of choice, Soma.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Dr. Wells says that women like me with wide pelvises

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
ought to have their first simulated pregnancy when they're 17.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't usually like wide pelvises.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Somehow you carry a 12.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So anyway, I'm really two years late, not two years early.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Are you taking your ovarian?

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Of course.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And your placentin?

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Of course, Lenina. I'm not a dimwit epsilon.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It'll be a pain all weekend if you don't go out and have sex with someone.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But if I do have a simulated pregnancy,

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I shan't be able to have sex for a whole three months.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Not nice.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Doesn't bear thinking about.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
All the signs were there, but people didn't want to acknowledge them.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Greed bent the post-Enlightenment West out of shape.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A very few people owned the wealth,

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and they declared war on the intelligence of the populations of the developed world.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
America elected an amoral, aggressive gangster

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to the most powerful job anywhere.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He let loose the dogs who turned civilization

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
into a global cult of numbskull consumerism

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
which would believe any rubbish

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
as long as it justified breakneck consumption of sugar, drugs, and no-strings sex.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I assume you're going out?

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
With who?

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Henry Foster.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why are you still going out with him?

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's only been four months.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Four months is a lifetime.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Surely you're bored at sex with one man.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, no, actually.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm not bored.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I find it... comfortable.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Comforting.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The director would be very upset.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He and I did it last week.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, yes? How was it?

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Very dignified.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Vigorous, mind you.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, good.

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But dignified.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's the best word.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Although it's an everyday thing for us,

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I imagine you'll be confused.

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You see, for us now, promiscuity is the rule, not the exception.

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And there has been a deliberate process of blurring the line

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
which used to separate childhood and sex.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Sex is a proven commercial proposition.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Childhood doesn't come anywhere near it in terms of profit.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
To be honest, I haven't been feeling very promiscuous lately.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There are times when I'd just rather not be doing it.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But you've got to make the effort.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Even if you don't want to.

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
After all, everyone...

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Belongs to everyone else.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I have thought about it.

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Although I do find Henry a bit tedious,

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
just having any old sex with any old man seems a bit pointless.

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Better the lover you know sort of thing.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Careful who you say that to.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You won't exactly make yourself popular.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Of course, you started all this.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Relationships require effort.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And that kind of stamina got lost in your quick-fix world,

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
where electronic devices enabled everyone to scan their immediate surroundings

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
for the opportunity of a spot of spontaneous, blameless carnality.

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Do you know Bernard Marx?

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're not serious.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Why not? He's an alpha plus.

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He's asked me if I want to go on holiday with him to New Mexico.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've always wanted to see the reservations.

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I could go on about how your time got scared of global warming

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and disguised a land grab as a war between freedom and theocracy

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and how you pasted over the cracks with aggressive sentimentality.

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But I won't.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
His face doesn't really fit.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
People say Bernard actually chooses to spend time on his own.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm fond of Bernard.

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He's bright and sees through the gruesome gaiety of this world.

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He's the closest thing to a friend that I have.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But sadly, I don't think he's got much strength of character.

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Well, I think he's clever and perceptive.

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There's nothing attractive about Bernard Marx.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He's too small. He's not at all handsome.

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He looks like he didn't get enough oxygen when he was in the flask.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He's got funny little feet, like a girl.

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He knew perfectly well what small feet mean.

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, don't go on.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He's got frizzy hair.

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why would you want to be seen with someone like that?

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think he's interesting.

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Bernard Marx has a thoughtful nature.

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What's that got to do with anything?

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
People will just think you're a bit stupid.

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You know what, Fanny?

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You've helped me make up my mind.

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, I'm stumped, but I suppose it's better than sticking with Henry.

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That really could get you into trouble.

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I was a drinking, career-orientated fellow once,

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
an escalator squash champion who'd had 640 girls in four years.

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Then the veil fell from my eyes, the niggling sense of wrongness took over.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And now I'm a secret dissident who wishes he wasn't but can't help it.

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There's no mystery left in our brave new world.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
No chase, no alluring electrical charges skittering over the surface

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and tremulous, fractured conversations, human to human.

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No, it's perfunctory and desperately, depressingly, aggressively dull.

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Have you got some Soma you can lend me?

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't use it much these days. It takes the edge off.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Really? I can't imagine having sex without it.

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I can't imagine anything without it.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You will by now have realised I'm talking to you from the future.

153
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
100 years into the future, as a matter of fact.

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, and thank you for laying the foundations of the reality I have to live with every day.

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes, thanks a bunch.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Come along now everyone, don't dawdle.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I enjoy these face-to-face sessions with the student body,

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
but as the director of the London Hatcheries, I can't hide myself away with you all afternoon.

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sir, someone said you'd be teaching the electro-aversive therapy module yourself.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I used to, but not this year.

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I am an academic too, but in the College of Emotional Engineering.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I do a lot with media and conditioning, and mostly that involves making up stories,

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
or more accurately, fictions, that convince our people they're happy.

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I know how it all works from the rancid core outwards.

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Please stay with me as I reveal my world piece by rotten piece.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Here is an eminent man giving his students a little tour.

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Please gather around, I don't like shouting.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We give some embryos less oxygen. That retards their development.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The lower the grade, the less the oxygen.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The first organ affected is the brain, after that the skeleton.

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
At 70% of normal oxygen you get dwarfs. At less than 70, eyeless abominations.

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Such a smooth voice. It makes the extremity of what he does somehow acceptable.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's the same voice which only has to ask politely,

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and any of the young women he's training will gladly hop into bed with him.

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Eugenics was, in your time, a dirty word, something the Nazis did.

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Now, it's a respectable trade.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You may ask, what does the hatchery hatch?

178
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The answer is human beings.

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We predestine and condition.

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We decant our babies as socialised human beings, as alphas or epsilons,

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
as future sewage workers or future directors of hatcheries.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's move on up to the next floor.

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How many goodly creatures are there here.

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
How beauteous mankind is.

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
A brave new world that has such people in it.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Lowering the temperature in the incubators and bombarding them with x-rays

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
leaves the grown human being with a horror of cold.

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
These drones are predestined to emigrate to the tropics.

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
They're miners, acetate silk spinners and steel workers.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And why would that be appropriate?

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
They thrive on heat.

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And that, in a nutshell, is the secret of happiness.

193
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Liking what you've got to do.

194
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Training teachers like me is high risk.

195
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
They have to be educated to do their job,

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
but they mustn't be educated enough that they start to question how things are done.

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The tendency towards doubt must be neutralised.

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If not, the result is self-loathing, anti-social behaviour

199
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and ultimately the penal system.

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You can see from the sign this is where we condition the Alpha Plus intellectuals.

201
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We need them smart, but thinking along pretty narrow pathways.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They must above all else be useful.

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So we show the Alpha toddlers paintings from the past.

204
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The names of novelists in big letters and other artefacts from dead history.

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
While they're taking all that in, we hit them with huge volumes of industrial sound

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and give them electric shocks through the carpet.

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They dance and cry like puppets.

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We do it repeatedly.

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
For them, books and paintings and words become associated with pain.

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So they grow up safe from unhelpful ideas and ambitions,

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
hating those useless old things all their lives.

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hating what the old order called enquiry.

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But it doesn't work in every case.

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
There isn't even the old pretense of democracy anymore.

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you resist, you risk either being exiled to Iceland

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
or banished to live with feral savages on reserves in America's far-flung places.

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The real world cloaks itself in a global system of ruthless nannying.

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Happiness and contentment are in force with the threat of physical violence.

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The state arranges us according to a biologically determined caste system.

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Sex is now a compulsory recreation.

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And the idea that children might be born to a human mother is just appallingly embarrassing.

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I hate this world.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But I'm impotent before its massive, pillow-like ministry.

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Everyone belongs to everyone else.

225
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Everyone belongs to everyone else.

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Apple, JP Morgan, Ford Motor Corporation, Walmart and Samsung.

227
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
These great companies are now universally recognised

228
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
as among the central figures in the creation of a stable social structure

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
founded on commercial priorities of production and consumption.

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Director, I...

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No more questions, I'm afraid. We're on the clock now.

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
150 years after Ford's first Model T went on sale,

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the principle of sleep teaching was discovered.

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We play children's lessons quietly into their ears, night after night,

235
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
from small communication devices.

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Elementary class consciousness and elementary sex

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
form the bedrock of teaching the under-8s,

238
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
elementary dislike of other castes

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and an elementary desire to have sex with as many partners

240
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
as time and opportunity will allow.

241
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Sexualising of the child while also making sure there's no impulse to reproduce.

242
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Those are the great victories of our time.

243
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The only relief from torment comes in the few seconds after I've woken up in the morning.

244
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's the pause between the dull ache of knowing something is wrong

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and the full-blown realisation of the truth.

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That the world is intellectually dead.

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We thought sleep teaching could be used to make intellectuals,

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
but we found it more useful as a way to inculcate the absolutes

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that determine rather than caress the mind.

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Ford was right. History is bunk.

251
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Thebes and Babylon, Knossos and Mycenae,

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Odysseus, Job, Jupiter and Jesus, Athens, Rome and Jerusalem,

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
the cathedrals, King Lear and the thoughts of Pascal,

254
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Passion, Requiem and Symphony, all bunk and now all gone.

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We are free, released, and that includes women's previous enslavement to pregnancy.

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh yes, women no longer have to suffer the horror of having a live baby

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
crawling about in their insolence.

258
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And we've all been relieved of the horror of growing up in a home with a family.

259
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I imagine it was terrifying.

260
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The public mind is cauterised by reverse morality.

261
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Friendship, love, simplicity,

262
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
they're all drowned by enforced promiscuity, sensual and intellectual,

263
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
self-love, materialism, fear of ageing, fear of wisdom.

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Can you pass my towel, Henry? I've got soap in my eye.

265
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I like to give her a whack on the thigh when we're at it.

266
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
See the ripple travel across and the livid pink from the smack.

267
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Towel, Henry. Thanks.

268
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Could you please not talk as if she's just meat?

269
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What's it to you? I'm the one going out with her. I can say what I like.

270
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
She's certainly worth you having a go on. Wonderfully pneumatic.

271
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
There you go again.

272
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I've asked her to come to New Mexico with me. She said she'd think it over.

273
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's fine.

274
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Is it?

275
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Look, Bernard, you don't have to ask my permission.

276
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Lenina and I enjoy each other. But it's time we took a break.

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So you're not getting possessive?

278
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't be daft. Lenina is convenient, that's all.

279
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm being lazy. I just needed a shove to get me moving to pastures new.

280
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Just think what it must have been like when people owned each other.

281
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
At least we don't have to meddle in the past. Unlike those poor archaeologists.

282
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What archaeologists? Didn't you see it? They're on the news feed.

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Some poor bugger dug up a crucifix the other day.

284
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Heaven and immortality and all that.

285
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Quite attractive ideas, though.

286
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
We're not serious. They were saps.

287
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And we just make do with soma.

288
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Are you being sarcastic again? We're lucky, Bernard. No old age.

289
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hormones, blood transfusions.

290
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes, nothing wrong with that.

291
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We don't change or learn, and our personalities remain in a steady state.

292
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Makes for a comfortable life.

293
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Until it's time for organ failure or dementia.

294
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And then we're carted off to a dying centre to be ogled at by school kids until we pop an artery.

295
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You mean you didn't enjoy those visits when you were a kid?

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
People used to get cleverer as they got older. More mature. Wiser.

297
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I just want to buy stuff and muck about for the rest of my days, thank you very much.

298
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If you want to get on, you'll muckle down and do the same.

299
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
After all, what did the past give us?

300
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What did all that history add up to?

301
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Nine years' war, massive damage right across the globe, chemical and biological destruction.

302
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And now collaborative government across the entire world means we can spend, spend, spend anywhere.

303
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I feel utterly bored all the time.

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I enjoy being bored. I like it very much. Very much indeed.

305
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Guess what, Bernard?

306
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Lenina! Where did you pop out from? I thought you'd be home by now.

307
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh, I have been home. I got dolled up and came out hunting for you.

308
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, guess what?

309
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What?

310
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I just saw Benito Hoover in the lift. I had to laugh.

311
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Why?

312
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Well, under those clothes, he's as hairy as a primate.

313
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Why would I want to know that?

314
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh, sorry. Sorry, have I said something wrong?

315
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It doesn't matter.

316
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Well, I understand, though. I do, Bernard.

317
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
One says those things because they're supposed to be funny, and I mean, most of the time they are.

318
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But these days, I find that sexy talk, I don't know.

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
A bit sad.

320
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What do you mean?

321
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Do me a favour, Lenina.

322
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What?

323
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Let's try and keep off the subject of your former conquests.

324
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I've been in a funny mood lately.

325
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Have you?

326
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I thought you were seeing Henry tonight.

327
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And George Edsel was in the lift, too.

328
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Why does that matter?

329
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I couldn't fancy someone with such big ears.

330
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Sorry, I'm just teasing you.

331
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You mentioned you wanted me to come to New Mexico.

332
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Did you mean it?

333
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes, of course.

334
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But look, I wouldn't want to put Henry's nose out of joint.

335
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He's not bothered.

336
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes, he said the same to me.

337
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You do want to have me, don't you?

338
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, absolutely.

339
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You haven't changed your mind, then?

340
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Absolutely not.

341
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Are we flying out on the Blue Bullet?

342
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yes.

343
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
From the Turing Tower or Hampstead?

344
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm not sure.

345
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's a lovely evening.

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Well, let's do something together, then.

347
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
No, I have to go. Henry gets cross if I keep him waiting.

348
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I thought he wasn't bothered.

349
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He just doesn't like lateness. Says it's rude.

350
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Well, let me know about the dates in good time, won't you, Bernard?

351
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
My era takes no account of the price the planet pays for consumption.

352
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
A small helicopter carves the heart out of the earth to make and run it.

353
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't own one. Many do.

354
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Titanium gouged from the Far Eastern landscape.

355
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Aviation fuel sucked from seabeds laid waste.

356
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Atmospheric warming, raising sea levels so whole island communities just vanish.

357
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Four minutes late, Lenina.

358
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm sorry, Henry. I got held up chatting to your little friend, Bernard Marks.

359
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Not really my friend.

360
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I mean, he's all right and so on, but don't run away with the impression we're close.

361
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Okay.

362
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But where are we going?

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Hold on.

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
There's the Red Bullet coming in from New York.

365
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's late, too.

366
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Those Atlantic services are always late.

367
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I thought we'd do a different route this time.

368
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Out over Notting Hill, Wilsdon, Ealing, the Hounslow-Feely studios.

369
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Then follow the Great West Road to Brentford, onto Stoke Poges for a round of obstacle golf.

370
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't like obstacle golf.

371
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
All those electronic things that jump out and spin.

372
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't see why we can't just hit the ball towards a hole.

373
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You're sounding like a vegetarian.

374
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I bet you've never met one.

375
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Anyway, what's being a vegetarian got to do with it?

376
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh, history, art, ecology, veggie, it's all the same.

377
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Being awkward for the sake of it.

378
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Oh, keep your hair on.

379
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I only said I wasn't keen on obstacle golf.

380
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Don't tell me to keep my hair on.

381
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We have a social responsibility to play things like obstacle golf.

382
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Otherwise the inventors and the manufacturers would be out of business.

383
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Anyway, what kind of idiots would be entertained by simply hitting a ball and wandering after it?

384
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
[ENGINE REVS]

385
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I asked my cocktail to be out of the hangar and ready by seven o'clock.

386
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What's going on?

387
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Sorry, Mr. Marks, it's these Bokanovskys.

388
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Much worse than Epsilon's.

389
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I have to take what's quoted.

390
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Seven identicals.

391
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Small, black and hideous.

392
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
As thick as two short planks.

393
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You tell them something and they forget before the words are out of your mouth.

394
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
In your time, you very nearly achieved a situation where skin colour didn't matter.

395
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But the wars and the migrations came, enemies were dehumanised through racial stereotypes,

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and the hatcheries shrunk brains accordingly.

397
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Ah, of course.

398
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't mean you're like that.

399
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You're an alpha, after all.

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Just a short one.

401
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Are you going anywhere nice?

402
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Nice?

403
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Are you saying you have to file a flight plan, which I don't believe you do.

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Well, actually, I do, Mr. Marks.

405
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Then write down I'm going to Propaganda House on Fleet Street.

406
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Ah. Whom shall you be seeing there?

407
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
My friend Helmholtz Watson.

408
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He's an alpha plus and he lectures in the Department of Writing at the College of Emotional Engineering.

409
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Helm... Holtz?

410
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It used to be only Americans who suffered from the poor spelling of semi-literate officials,

411
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
meeting them at Ellis Island and scrawling approximations of their names.

412
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Now the whole world has to put up with the gaffes of petty low-caste officialdom.

413
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You look a bit flummoxed.

414
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Unusual name. I haven't come across it before.

415
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Do you want me to write it down for you?

416
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Would you? That would be very helpful.

417
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Helmholtz, my dear fellow. How have you been?

418
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Bernard.

419
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Kept myself this side of suicidal.

420
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Just when you think you're getting immune to stupid people, one of them does something really awful.

421
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Last week they were changing the office furniture around and someone found an actual book tucked behind some shelves.

422
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Erewhon it was called.

423
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
As you know, I love books.

424
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We were allowed restricted access to them when I was training.

425
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's when I started keeping a diary.

426
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Shhh, Helmholtz. What about the microphones?

427
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh, it's after hours.

428
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The acoustic people go home on the dot of five.

429
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's one of the many ineptitudes of totalitarianism.

430
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Anyway, instead of treating the book as a curio,

431
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
they phoned the police who came and put it in a sealed container ready to be incinerated.

432
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Is that someone's name? Erewhon?

433
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Bernard, think about it.

434
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What do you mean?

435
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's nowhere spelled backwards.

436
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The writer's name was Samuel Butler.

437
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What was the subject of the book?

438
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Who knows? I caught a glance of the back cover.

439
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Dystopian, it said. Whatever that means.

440
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Right, I'm done. Let's get out of here.

441
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The press club?

442
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Why not?

443
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Let's see if anyone interesting is in tonight.

444
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You know, Helmholtz, you really do need to be a bit more careful.

445
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You're too damn clever. It makes people suspicious of you.

446
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I get someone to say, not because I'm clever, but because I'm too damn short.

447
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And I'm just built too damn big.

448
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You'd think in a seat of learning, we'd be beyond this claptrap.

449
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Toe the line.

450
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Keep your head down.

451
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The academia's now a byword for brown-nosing and knitting your brow at people like me.

452
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
To be honest, I've no idea why they still trust me, the student.

453
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Words are dangerous. And wordsmiths are simply not to be trusted.

454
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
We like to think of ourselves as rebels, don't we? You and I.

455
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But actually, we're just tame monkeys.

456
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
They keep us as pets so they can show off how enlightened they are.

457
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's a measure of how limp we are that we're still employed.

458
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
As soon as we became a real threat, we'd be out on our ears, or much worse.

459
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I got a dressing down from the director of the hatchery yesterday.

460
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Well, that's what he thought he was doing.

461
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I walked into his office to ask for a permit to fly to New Mexico to have a peep at the ferals.

462
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I want to take a girl with me.

463
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Has she got a brain?

464
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yes, actually. I'm quite optimistic about her.

465
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The New Mexico reservation, I see.

466
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Hmm. I went there once.

467
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Must have been your age. So, 25 years ago, then.

468
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Don't look so worried.

469
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And for a while he went rambling on, got lost in his own memories of trekking in the reservations.

470
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I had the same idea.

471
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I got a permit for New Mexico, took a girl to look at the savages.

472
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
She was a beta minus.

473
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yellow hair, particularly pneumatic.

474
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We peered at the feral savages and rode about on horses.

475
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And then she got lost up some revolting mountain.

476
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
What did he mean, lost?

477
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
He certainly let something slip there.

478
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Something he didn't intend to.

479
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I went to sleep and she must have gone for a walk.

480
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
When I woke up, she wasn't there.

481
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And there was a huge thunderstorm.

482
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I searched and I shouted.

483
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
She must have fallen into a gully or been eaten by a mountain lion.

484
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I dream about it sometimes.

485
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Fancy that.

486
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And then he seemed to come to.

487
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Woke up, sort of thing.

488
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Realised what he'd said.

489
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Don't get the wrong idea.

490
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
There was nothing wrong about our relationship.

491
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Nothing emotional or drawn out.

492
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And that's when he made a pathetic attempt to turn the tables by telling me off.

493
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I think I ought to take this opportunity, Mr. Marks,

494
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
to say I am not at all pleased with what I hear of your behaviour away from work.

495
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I have the good name of the hatchery centre to think of.

496
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
High-caste staff must be above suspicion.

497
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So, he lost his marbles.

498
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Your director has an emotional side, then.

499
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
If I hear any more about you behaving strangely,

500
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
undermining the code that forbid monogamy and free thinking,

501
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I will transfer you to the hatchery sub-centre in Iceland.

502
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Oh, yes.

503
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
He thought he'd given me a dressing down.

504
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But I banged the door behind me as I went.

505
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And I imagine you swaggered a bit and whistled as you walked away down the corridor.

506
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I did, as a matter of fact.

507
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Bernard!

508
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You were warning me just now, but if you're not careful,

509
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
that bastard's going to start a witch hunt.

510
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm not afraid.

511
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And you should be.

512
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You're fond of boasting and showing off your disdain

513
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
to people who are too stupid to put up with it.

514
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Ah, at last. The lift's here.

515
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Professor Helmholtz, what a nice surprise.

516
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yes.

517
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Dolores, isn't it?

518
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That's right. Dolores Schenectady.

519
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm in your second semester class on image manipulation.

520
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And who are you?

521
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Oh, you don't know me.

522
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What a coincidence, bumping into you, Professor.

523
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
She's not telling the truth.

524
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We've been riding this lift for the last 20 minutes, hoping to catch you.

525
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Why would you do that?

526
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
We thought you might come and have a picnic supper with us on Dartmoor.

527
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
No, I don't think so.

528
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm with my friend here.

529
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm afraid we weren't planning to share you with anyone else.

530
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
We want to eat and drink and make love on a mountain.

531
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Both of us and just you.

532
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You're such a big chap.

533
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
We want to try you out, find out if everything is in proportion.

534
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And also, you're a bit thrilling, aren't you?

535
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Am I?

536
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
A dark horse.

537
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Mysterious.

538
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
An enigma.

539
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'd like to be able to say you've had me.

540
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Me too.

541
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Here we are. Ground floor.

542
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Oh, dear. We're ready.

543
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Afraid so.

544
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Now then, I've been looking forward to seeing my friend here.

545
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But the whole point was two on one.

546
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I wasn't suggesting a double date.

547
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We were two of us, one of you.

548
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But if you'd rather go out with your friend, well, it's disappointing,

549
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
but it's your lookout, I'm afraid.

550
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
See you around.

551
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Thank you, I suppose.

552
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Goodbye, then.

553
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
These young women.

554
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
They're too awful for words.

555
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's Lenina Crown.

556
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What?

557
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The girl I'm taking to New Mexico.

558
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Her name is Lenina Crown.

559
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Do I know her?

560
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
She's training at the Central London Hatchery.

561
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
We're on different floors.

562
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You know, I really can't stand all this anymore.

563
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I've cut out all my regular girls.

564
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Of course, the Dean has made a fuss about it.

565
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You'll lose your post if you're not careful.

566
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Haven't you ever felt uncomfortable living like this?

567
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
All the time.

568
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But to be honest, I don't know why.

569
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I've been working on some ideas.

570
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I think we weren't made for all this promiscuity.

571
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
We're not instinctual creatures anymore.

572
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We're cultural creatures.

573
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We weren't made for some great natural world competition

574
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
to spill our genes into every passing female.

575
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We've lost the sense of connection between sex and love

576
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and the great story of life.

577
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Our lives are like a series of bus stops.

578
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
We get off at one for a while...

579
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Then get back on the bus and then get off at the next stop

580
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and the next and the next.

581
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
There's no epic sweep to it.

582
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That's brilliant.

583
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Oh, great phrase.

584
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I want to write about it, but I don't have the tough words I need.

585
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Our language feels mimsy-pimsy in comparison to the way

586
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I believe people used to speak.

587
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Every now and again, you hear an unfamiliar word

588
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
with thick, coarse contours, and it hints at a past

589
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
when people could talk tough and think tough as a result.

590
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You look like you're in pain, Hamilt.

591
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I need better words.

592
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
More violent words.

593
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
One thing I know for sure.

594
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I can't go on writing about nothing that matters.

595
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
While I'm away...

596
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Away where?

597
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
New Mexico with this girl.

598
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh, yes.

599
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
While I'm away, will you keep a lookout for me?

600
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What do you mean?

601
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm convinced the DLH said more to me about New Mexico

602
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
than he intended.

603
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I don't want to get stabbed in the back in my absence

604
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
just to let him off the hook.

605
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'll keep my ears open.

606
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Call me any time, day or night, if you hear Iceland

607
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and my name in the same sentence.

608
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Come on.

609
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
(train rumbling)

610
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So this really is a date, Bernard?

611
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Yes. Well, yes.

612
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But a kind of preliminary date.

613
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
A sort of mutual test drive

614
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
before we go all the way to America together.

615
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Where shall we fly off to this afternoon?

616
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I was thinking about swimming at Torquay Country Club.

617
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And then maybe we could have dinner at the Oxford Union.

618
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Both of those are going to be very crowded.

619
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I suppose you want to play obstacle golf, then.

620
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm afraid I find that a waste of time.

621
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh, good. I'm glad.

622
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Why?

623
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Because I don't see the point of it either.

624
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Say that again. Pardon?

625
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Why don't you like obstacle golf?

626
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
All the electronic gizmos that make it so difficult are just silly.

627
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'd rather be in bed having sex or dancing or eating a nice meal.

628
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Lenina, I've been searching for someone like you.

629
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What am I like, then?

630
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And if you say "interesting", I'm going to ask to go straight home.

631
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
What's wrong with being interesting?

632
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
That's what people say about ugly women.

633
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
"Oh, that Jackie so-and-so, she's really interesting."

634
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm not a brave man, Lenina.

635
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But I think I know what matters.

636
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And I hope one day to find someone with whom I can share...

637
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh, I don't know.

638
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Share an affinity with whom I can be spontaneous.

639
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Spontaneous?

640
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's a bit of a naughty word.

641
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
A bit sort of tingly.

642
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I like you using racy words like that.

643
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I know.

644
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Why don't we stop talking and leave London without planning anything?

645
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm supposed to punch in a flight plan.

646
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I have been up in helicopters lots of times with men who've forgotten to send a flight plan.

647
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Nobody cares about them, really. It's just a silly rule.

648
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I wouldn't want to draw too much attention.

649
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So you don't want to be spontaneous?

650
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
All right. I'm going to take you somewhere that's completely isolated.

651
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Bernard, there's no need. We'll be together by ourselves all night.

652
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I mean somewhere majestic.

653
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You really are completely off the scale, Bernard.

654
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Bonkers! But I like it.

655
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Do you want some soba?

656
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Absolutely not. I want to be wide awake with you, Lenina.

657
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Drinking in the sight and sound and smell of you.

658
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I should run a mile.

659
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
There's something about you, Mr. Marx.

660
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Hold on.

661
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
All that water, where are we?

662
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Heading out over the Thames estuary.

663
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You mean we're over the sea? Where are we going?

664
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
The North Sea. Look.

665
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
No, but it's horrible. It's cloudy and the surface is very lumpy.

666
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Turn the radio on, please, quickly.

667
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
No.

668
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,000
What?

669
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I don't want that incessant, Mark. I want to look out at the sea and feel lost.

670
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
We're not lost, though.

671
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But that's how I want to feel.

672
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But music takes your mind off things. And to tell you the truth, I'm getting a bit scared.

673
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Why on earth be scared?

674
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The land is disappearing. There's nothing but greeny-grayness.

675
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It makes me feel as though I'm more me, not so completely part of someone else's plan.

676
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Why do you get these unsettling ideas?

677
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
For my friend Helmuth. He's got a brain the size of a planet and he's brilliant.

678
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And he's unhappy and hates everything all the time.

679
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Don't you think we should turn around?

680
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Don't you want to be free, though, Lenina?

681
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Not if this is what you mean. Besides, I am happy. Sort of.

682
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And I think I feel as free as I want to be.

683
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh, yes. Everyone's happy nowadays.

684
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Wouldn't you like to be free in your own way?

685
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I think you'd better take me back to London.

686
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But we're more intimate here. More together, aren't we?

687
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
With nothing but the sea and the moon. No one can hear us or see us.

688
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Please don't be angry, but I'm not really coping. Can we go home now?

689
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
All right, then. We'll go back.

690
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I've always had a bad feeling about Bernard. He's quite frail.

691
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Tends to jump at things without considering the consequences.

692
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I worry that he misreads me. I've got used to keeping a part of me sacred.

693
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
The part that knows this world is a pale shadow of what it should be.

694
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And that they did things better in the past.

695
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I've learned not to take hold of the rope with which I might be permitted to hang myself.

696
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Bernard is an idealist. And an idealist is just one notch away from a martyr.

697
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Anyway, Bernard returned to London and took Lenina to his apartment.

698
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
He was in a strange mood. Hysterical. Chugging down Soma like it was sweeties.

699
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I know what's supposed to happen now.

700
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'll put some music on. Something smooth and romantic.

701
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And then you'll take hold of that diagonal zipper and slowly draw it down across your body.

702
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Then step out of your jumpsuit and walk to the bathroom, passing close enough that I can smell your scent.

703
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Certainly.

704
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I am trying to behave as one ought to.

705
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Pardon?

706
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You look lovely. Pneumatic.

707
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Er... not too skinny, though.

708
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Perfect. Perfect muscular elongated haunches. Perfect cuts of meat.

709
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
What?

710
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's something my friend Helmholtz said, the way people talk about women.

711
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You know, I didn't want today to end in us just going to bed.

712
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Then what did you want?

713
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I wanted, just for once, to try for a real connection.

714
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
For sex to come with a garnish. I wanted to be made to wait.

715
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Tantalised.

716
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I didn't want just to be given it on a plate, accompanied by a limp smile.

717
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I don't think my smile is limp.

718
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
That's not what I meant. I'm getting mixed up.

719
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I want to build to a climax.

720
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I want to start from nowhere and get worked up.

721
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I want us to do it in a frenzy, pulling and pushing at each other like savages.

722
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
You poor thing. You're very romantic, aren't you?

723
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I don't believe that's an affliction.

724
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
We're taught romance is degenerate.

725
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
All the same, Bernard, I do like you.

726
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You have nice hands.

727
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I just wish you weren't so odd.

728
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Now, come on. I'll take the lead, if you like.

729
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm in your hands.

730
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Bernard kept his word.

731
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
A week later, he and Lenina rocketed across the Atlantic Ocean

732
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and were soon exploring a huge, utterly tasteless room

733
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
in a New Mexico mid-range casino hotel,

734
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
all mustard-coloured plastic and brown Hessian walls.

735
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Ah, you're here. I was waiting by the reception desk, but that's fine.

736
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
What do you need to talk to us about?

737
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You can't rush this sort of thing.

738
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Better safe than sorry when it comes to going out to the reservations.

739
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
There's no actual danger, though?

740
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
These days, no.

741
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
The ferals, or savages as you Brits call them,

742
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
have experienced reprisals when they've gotten out of order.

743
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
They're pretty amiable now.

744
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Mind you, you're in for a shock.

745
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
There's no television where you're going.

746
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
No hot water, even.

747
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Did you hear that, Lenina?

748
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I think I can manage.

749
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You mustn't come to the reservation unless you really want to.

750
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I've made up my mind, I think.

751
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Very well, then.

752
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
All righty.

753
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So, ladies and gentlemen...

754
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Lady and gentle man.

755
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
The Malpais reservation covers 560,000 square kilometres

756
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
and is divided into four distinct sub-reservations.

757
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Each is surrounded by a high-tension wire fence.

758
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Damn.

759
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
What's the matter?

760
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I had to telephone Helmholtz-Watson. I just remembered.

761
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
The reservation is supplied with current by the Grand Canyon hydroelectric station.

762
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Could we hurry up? I need to make a call.

763
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Upwards of 5,000 kilometres of fencing run around each sub-reservation,

764
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
carrying a current of 60,000 volts.

765
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Really? How fascinating.

766
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Touching the fence will result in instantaneous death.

767
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
There is, as you will have gathered, no escape from a savage reservation.

768
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I ought to make that call.

769
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Perhaps I should say there is no escape for those born on the reservation.

770
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And remember, my dear young lady, in the reservation children are born.

771
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Oh, whoops. Do you really have to use that word?

772
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
We're in a wild place, miss.

773
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yes, they are actually born.

774
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Revolting as it may seem, those born on the reservation are destined to die there.

775
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Destined to die? That's fine. Let's stop there.

776
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I have to carry on, I'm afraid.

777
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
If you ask me how many people live on the reservation, I have to say we do not know.

778
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
We can only guess.

779
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
About 60,000 Indians and half-breeds.

780
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Absolute savages.

781
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Our inspectors occasionally visit them,

782
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
but otherwise they have no communication with the outside world.

783
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
They still preserve such repulsive customs as marriage, if you know what that is.

784
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Families.

785
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
No conditioning of the children of any serious kind.

786
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Monstrous superstitions.

787
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Christianity.

788
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Ancestor worship, that sort of thing.

789
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
The use of extinct languages.

790
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Sunni, Spanish, Athapaskan.

791
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
There are ferocious animals such as pumas and porcupines.

792
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
There are infectious diseases.

793
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Priests and venomous lizards.

794
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
How fascinating.

795
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
My phone is ringing.

796
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I can't hear it.

797
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's on vibrate.

798
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm just going to nip at you two to carry on.

799
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Uh-huh.

800
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So...

801
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Hello, Bernard.

802
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I thought you were in America.

803
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I am, but I needed to call you.

804
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You said the other day you were going to dig around to find out where I really stand with the director of the London Hatcheries.

805
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And I did.

806
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I was going to leave it until you got back, but I didn't want to spoil your holiday.

807
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Go on, then.

808
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The director of the London Hatcheries said something indirectly in public yesterday about you.

809
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
What was it?

810
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That he's looking for someone to take your place.

811
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Did he mention anything about Iceland?

812
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yes, I'm afraid he did.

813
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
He mentioned how much they needed quality staff like you out there.

814
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh, no.

815
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
What's the matter, Bernard?

816
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm going to be sent to Iceland.

817
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Excuse me, I have to finish the briefing.

818
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Carry on, then.

819
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Don't be alarmed, but it's best you're prepared.

820
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
What for?

821
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
When we fly in over the electric fence, you'll see a lot of carcasses inside the wire.

822
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The animals never learn what the fence really is and what it will do to them.

823
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You will be staying at the Malpais Rest House.

824
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
There will be a dance there this evening.

825
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I will take you there accompanied by my own sullen young savage.

826
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
He'll keep you amused.

827
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
He's funny, the way he pulls faces and jumps about.

828
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
But don't worry, we'll be back here tomorrow.

829
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Just remember, they are perfectly tame.

830
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Savages won't do you any harm.

831
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
They've had plenty of torture and starvation when they act up.

832
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
He absolutely stinks.

833
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
He actually makes me feel sick.

834
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Who does?

835
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Our guide.

836
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
What?

837
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I don't like his face. It's peculiar.

838
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Halfway between a Chinaman and an Asian, I don't like looking at it.

839
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Anyway, when he's going ahead, his back shows he hates us.

840
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
His back?

841
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Can't you see? His back is making no secret of it.

842
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So what? We need him to get us to the village.

843
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Oh, he's got another whiff.

844
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Why did the helicopter have to leave us at the rest house?

845
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Why couldn't they fly us up here? I hate walking.

846
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
But you feel so small when you're on the ground at the bottom of a hill.

847
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Who are all these people?

848
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
They're the villagers.

849
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Why are they dressed like that? They're practically naked.

850
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
What's that horrible guide called?

851
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
The Nina.

852
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
The true spirit of adventure requires we observe, study, try to understand.

853
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
We don't need to be spoon-fed at running commentary. Besides, they don't speak English.

854
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
They're like children. They've woven furry stuff into their hair.

855
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And those feather cloaks are fantastic.

856
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Imagine the work.

857
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
What are these two doing? What do they think they're carrying?

858
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Snakes, I believe.

859
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Keep them away. Keep them away from me.

860
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
There they go.

861
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Where's that sneaky, horrible guide chap gone? He's done this deliberately.

862
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
He knows we weren't supposed to be left on our own.

863
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
He went into that cave thing.

864
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
How can they bear to live like this?

865
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
This is a prison, Lenina.

866
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
They can't just leave.

867
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
They've lived like this for centuries. I suppose they must have got used to it.

868
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
No one has invited them into the civilised world.

869
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Look at that man on the ladder.

870
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
He's so skinny and slow.

871
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
With a terrible body like that, he should have the decency to cover up.

872
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
What's wrong with him?

873
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Give me some Soma.

874
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I don't have any.

875
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
What, you didn't bring any with you?

876
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
No.

877
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Oh, great.

878
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And now what's happening? What are those women doing?

879
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
They're feeding their babies from their breasts.

880
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It looks like a wonderfully intimate relationship, doesn't it?

881
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I think we miss out on not having mothers.

882
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And perhaps you'll miss out as well by not being a mother, Lenina.

883
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yuck. Please, Bernard.

884
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'd rather you didn't swear like that.

885
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You know, the M word.

886
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I confess I was jealous when I heard the details of their trip.

887
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I've not been to the reservations.

888
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I've not seen the savages first hand.

889
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It's a regret.

890
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I would love to have been exposed to that decrepitude, the smells,

891
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
the way other lives can be led.

892
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Bernard has his fascination with science,

893
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
but I would really have liked to have watched Lenina's face,

894
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
watched those layers of crudeness being peeled back.

895
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
What's the matter with that?

896
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Is it a woman?

897
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
She's got a huge thing around her neck.

898
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
That's called a goiter.

899
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Yuck.

900
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
We did experiments on that condition.

901
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It's fascinating, actually.

902
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
A goiter is a swelling of the neck

903
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
associated with a thyroid gland that's not functioning properly.

904
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
90% of cases are caused by preventable iodine deficiency,

905
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
which is a significant cause of intellectual disability.

906
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It typically occurs on remote inland areas where no marine foods are eaten.

907
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It's also common in mountainous regions of the world

908
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
where food is grown in iodine-poor soil.

909
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
They should eat fish.

910
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The ocean is only an hour away by helicopter.

911
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I don't have helicopters.

912
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Well, someone should do something.

913
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Ferals don't matter. No-one thinks their suffering is a problem.

914
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Well, it looks like a pretty big problem for her,

915
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and it's a problem for me having to look at it.

916
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
He wants to take us inside to look at her dwelling.

917
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Oh, you must be kidding.

918
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
(GROANING)

919
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Smoke, burnt fat, sweat and a bucket of poo.

920
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You really know how to give a girl a good time.

921
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You should broadcast on the Holiday Channel.

922
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I think this cave passes through the rock, and there, out there,

923
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
there's another terrace. Can you see?

924
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That's where the drums have been taken.

925
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Can you feel the mood, the excitement?

926
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh, there's... there's something nasty going on.

927
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Why am I not surprised?

928
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
There's blood.

929
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
They're scourging him. What?

930
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I brought you here because I genuinely thought you'd be interested.

931
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Why don't you give your brain a chance?

932
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
What the...?

933
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Just look at what's going on.

934
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
They're whacking and scratching him in time with the drums.

935
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
He's a sacrifice. It's a bloodletting.

936
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I am not going out there. It's a classic scapegoat situation.

937
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
One person is symbolically sacrificed

938
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
to wipe away the sins of the community.

939
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It's the... you know, the Jesus thing.

940
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Why are you talking like that? It's disgusting.

941
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Look at the way the boy's welcoming it.

942
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Look at him smiling so proudly.

943
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
He clearly doesn't want to run away. It's an honour.

944
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
To... to perhaps make the crops grow,

945
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
to perhaps show them he's a man.

946
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Oh, it's fascinating.

947
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
My son would have been a much better choice.

948
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
The multitudinous seas incarnadine.

949
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Er, what?

950
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It's not fair.

951
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
They won't let me be the sacrifice.

952
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I could have bled twice as much and not felt it.

953
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
You're civilised, aren't you?

954
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You come from the other place.

955
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Well, you look like us, not them.

956
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And the Indians hate me because I'm fair.

957
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Linda is my mother.

958
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Don't look at her like that, Cerdos.

959
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
How did you get here?

960
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I came from London a long time ago.

961
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
(COUGHS)

962
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Before he was born with the bastardo who was his father.

963
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
She doesn't like talking about it.

964
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
My mother...

965
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Oh, do you have to use that word?

966
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But that's what she is, perra orgullosa.

967
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
No, please, don't take offence.

968
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Please, please, carry on.

969
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
She went walking alone in the mountains to the north.

970
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
She fell into a ravine and hurt her head.

971
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Go on. Please.

972
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Hunters from Malpais found her and brought her to the pueblo.

973
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Linda never saw my cobarde father again.

974
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Linda, what was his name?

975
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'd rather not talk about it.

976
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Su nombre es Tomas.

977
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
That's the first name of the director of the London Hatchery.

978
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I don't think you should jump to any conclusions.

979
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Something similar happened when he came to New Mexico.

980
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
How do you know? He told me himself.

981
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
He wouldn't have told you if he thought there was a chance you'd run into her.

982
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Unless he was convinced she's dead.

983
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Maybe he tried to kill her. Maybe he thought it succeeded.

984
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
He thought we died.

985
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Both of us.

986
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Him inside me.

987
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Si. Muerto.

988
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Otherwise he would not have had the courage to leave.

989
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
My mother doesn't talk about it because...

990
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
¿Le duele el corazón?

991
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It hurts her heart.

992
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
She tries not to care about what Tomas did to her.

993
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
But I see the sorrow in her face every day when the mezcal wears off.

994
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
He must have been a bad man.

995
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Un hombre no natural.

996
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
To run away and leave her alone.

997
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
To fly away and leave me as well.

998
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
There will be a judgement on him one day.

999
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Come on, Bernard. The director of Hatcheries wouldn't have partnered.

1000
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Slept with.

1001
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Covered.

1002
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Someone like that.

1003
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
You mean someone immensely fat.

1004
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
With a lined face.

1005
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Sagging cheeks.

1006
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Two teeth missing at the last count.

1007
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Stinking of drink.

1008
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And unwashed.

1009
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Oh my dear. Mi querida.

1010
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I didn't always look like this.

1011
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
You see, here we actually do get old.

1012
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I've still got the clothes I came in.

1013
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Put away in a box.

1014
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
But they don't fit.

1015
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,000
They haven't for a long time.

1016
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
There's no soma here.

1017
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I only have mezcal.

1018
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
When the man, Papi, brings it.

1019
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Estaba tan avergonzada.

1020
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
So ashamed.

1021
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Me.

1022
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
A pita.

1023
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Having a baby.

1024
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I still don't know how it happened.

1025
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I don't know what to say.

1026
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
There are no handkerchiefs here either.

1027
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
There's just filth.

1028
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Filth.

1029
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
How did you meet Thomas?

1030
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I worked in the fertilising room at the central London hatchery.

1031
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
That's where I work.

1032
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
The way they make babies here.

1033
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And relationships.

1034
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
No doubt you all think it's disgusting.

1035
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Tell us.

1036
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
In your world, everybody belongs to everybody else.

1037
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But here, nobody is supposed to belong to more than one person.

1038
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And if you have people in the civilised way, lots of them,

1039
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
these people think you're wicked and antisocial.

1040
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
They don't know anything about controlling their fertility.

1041
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Las mujeres, the women here, have children over and over again.

1042
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Like dogs.

1043
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But how did you manage to get pregnant before you came here?

1044
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I said I don't know.

1045
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
But anyway, John has been a great comfort to me.

1046
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Te amo, madre.

1047
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
He has tried to kill some of the men when they come near me.

1048
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Men like Papi with his mezcal.

1049
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
John gets his ideas from the Indians.

1050
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
He has always spent time with them, despite the fact they don't like him.

1051
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I couldn't condition him.

1052
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I don't know how to.

1053
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Don't you dare look down on us.

1054
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Pardon?

1055
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I've been watching the girl's face.

1056
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You mean me?

1057
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
How do your women avoid getting pregnant?

1058
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Chemicals.

1059
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Productos químicos.

1060
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And where do you get them from?

1061
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Out of bottles.

1062
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
No, I mean, how are they made?

1063
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
In factories.

1064
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
That's right.

1065
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
But how?

1066
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I don't know.

1067
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Do you know, Bernard?

1068
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
No, not really.

1069
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
The Indians know more than you.

1070
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,000
The great god Awona-Wilona made all things out of the fog of increase.

1071
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
His seed was laid in four wombs to make all that we find on earth.

1072
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
You used some words just now when we met you.

1073
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Strange words that I seem to have heard before.

1074
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
The multitude in a sea's incarnadine.

1075
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Where did you get that?

1076
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
William Shakespeare.

1077
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
We managed to get rid of him.

1078
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But to live in the rank sweat of unseamed bed,

1079
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
stewed in corruption,

1080
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
hunting and making love over the nasty star.

1081
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
The dealer, Papi, who came and used my mother

1082
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
on the disabled wings of night.

1083
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
He brought me a book.

1084
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
The complete works of William Shakespeare.

1085
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
His words take something ugly and makes it again in the year.

1086
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
So it has beauty.

1087
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
A pesar de si mismo.

1088
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
What's he talking about?

1089
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Something we've lost, I fear.

1090
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Papi.

1091
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
A man who could smile and smile and be a villain, eh?

1092
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I tried to kill him when I was small.

1093
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I didn't succeed.

1094
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I would if I tried now.

1095
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
He bled.

1096
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
He stared into my eyes, bleeding, holding me down.

1097
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Pero el no me mato.

1098
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
He just left and we never saw him again.

1099
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
[coughing]

1100
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Are you--are you all right?

1101
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Is she--is she all right?

1102
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Oh, she's sick.

1103
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
The mezcal has made her sick.

1104
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
You look disgusted.

1105
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And bored.

1106
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
We're alone, you see.

1107
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Utterly alone.

1108
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
We only have each other.

1109
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
We speak English to each other.

1110
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And you are the first we have spoken to for many years.

1111
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It's very good of you to speak to me, Master Vermont.

1112
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You've told your story to three levels of administrators so far this morning

1113
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
and frightened the wits out of each intern.

1114
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Are you going to frighten the wits out of me?

1115
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
That isn't my intention.

1116
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
You only get one crack at speaking to the controller in Whitehall.

1117
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I hope you're going to impress me.

1118
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I have discovered an Englishwoman and her son living in squalor

1119
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
among the Indians of the Malpais reservation in New Mexico.

1120
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It has been explained to me.

1121
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I have listened to their story and I believe the director of Hatcher

1122
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
is deliberately disposed of this woman,

1123
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
possibly attempted to kill her, in order to avoid a scandal.

1124
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I want the woman and the boy recovered to civilization.

1125
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I shall within the next 15 minutes send the necessary orders

1126
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
to the warden of the reservation.

1127
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I would like you to proceed to the warden's office.

1128
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I expect you to accompany them back to London.

1129
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And, Mr. Marks... Yes?

1130
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I also expect absolute discretion in all matters pertaining to this affair.

1131
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
You will report directly to me and no-one else.

1132
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
You will be given the number for my private line

1133
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
and I expect to hear from you every day.

1134
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Good morning.
