1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Pygmalion, by me, George Bernard Shaw. Episode 1.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Episode 2.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Violets for sale. Would you like to buy some violets, milady?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm getting chilled to the bone. What can Freddie be doing all this time?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He's been gone 20 minutes.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So long. But he ought to have got us a cab by this.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You won't get no cab till half past eleven, missus, when they come back from troubling their theatre first.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We must have a cab. We can't stand here until half past eleven.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh, it's too bad.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If Freddie had a bit of gumption, he would have got one at the theatre door.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Would you like some violets? Would you like to buy some violets?

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, haven't you got a cab?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There's not one to be had for love or money.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, Freddie, there must be one. You can't have tried.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I tell you, they're all engaged.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've been to Charing Cross one way and nearly to Ludgate Circus the other, and they were all engaged.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You haven't tried at all.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You really are very helpless, Freddie.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Go again and don't come back until you have found a cab.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, very well. I'll go, I'll go.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, there then, Freddie. There you go, my dear.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There's money for you. Two bunches of violets trotting in the mud.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
How do you know that my son's name is Freddie, pray?

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He's your son, is he?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, if you've done your duty by him as a mother should,

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
he'd know better to spoil a poor girl's flowers than run away without paying.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Will you pay for them?

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Do nothing of the sort, Mother. It's the idea.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Please allow me, Clara. Have you any pennies?

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
No. I've nothing smaller than a sixpence.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can give you change for a tenner, kind lady.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Give it to me.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now, this is for your flowers.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you kindly, lady.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now, tell me how you know that young gentleman's name.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I didn't.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I heard you call him by it. Don't try to deceive me.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Who's trying to deceive you? I called him Freddie, you Charlie.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Same as you might yourself if you was talking to a stranger and wished to be pleasant.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Phew!

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, sir, is there any sign of it stopping?

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm afraid not. It started worse than ever about two minutes ago.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh, dear.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's nearly over. You should cheer up, Cap'n, and buy a flower for poor girl.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't any change.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I can give you change, Cap'n.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
For a sovereign? I've nothing less.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
God! Oh, do buy a flower off me, Cap'n.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can change half a crown. Take this for tappings.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now, don't be troublesome. There's a good girl.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I really haven't any change.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, stop.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Here's three halfpence if that's any good to you.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thank you, sir.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You be careful. Give him a flower for it.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There's a bloke here behind taking down every blessed word you're saying.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I ain't done nothing wrong by speaking to the gentleman.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I've a right to sell flowers if I keep off the curb.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I never spoke to him except to ask him to buy a flower off me.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I told you, Ed.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't be soft on him, will you?

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, sir, don't let him charge me.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You don't know what he means to me.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You take away my character and drive me on the street for speaking to gentlemen.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There, there, there. Who's hurting you, you silly girl?

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What do you take me for?

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's all right. He's a gentleman. Look at his boots.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
She thought you was a coppersnark, sir.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What's a coppersnark?

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, it's a coppersnark, as you might say.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What else would you call it?

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
A sort of informer.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll take my Bible out if I never say the word.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, shut up, shut up. Do I look like a policeman?

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And what do you take down my words for?

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You just show me what you wrote about me.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What's that? That ain't proper writing.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can't read that.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, I can.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Er, cheer up, Ketling, and buy a flower off a poor girl.

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's because I called him Ketling.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I meant no harm.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, sir, don't let him lay a charge against me for a word like that.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Charge? I make no charge.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Really, sir, anybody could see that the girl meant no harm.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's a gloomy busybody, that's all he is.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I tell you, look at his boots.

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And how are all your people down at Selsey?

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Who told you my people come from Selsey?

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Never you mind, they did.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And how do you come to be up so far east?

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You were born in Lisson Grove.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, what harm is there in my leaving Lisson Grove?

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It wasn't fit for a pig to live in,

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and I had to pay four and six a week.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh, live where you like, but stop that noise.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Come, come, he can't touch you.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You have a right to live where you please.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hey, hey, do you know where I come from?

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hoxton.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Who said I didn't?

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Like me, you know everything you do.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ain't no cool metal with me, eh?

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm a good girl, I am.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All right, what about this gentleman?

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Tell him where he come from if you want to go fortune-telling.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Ah, well, Sheltonham, Harrow, Cambridge, and India.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Quite right.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He knows all about it.

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
May I ask, sir, do you do this for your living at a musical?

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I've thought of that. Perhaps I shall someday.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What on earth is Freddie doing?

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I shall get pneumonia if I stay in this draft any longer.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Earl's Court.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Will you please keep your impertinent remarks to yourselves?

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Did I say that out loud? I didn't mean to.

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I beg your pardon. Your mother's Epsom, unmistakably.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How very curious.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I was brought up in Large Lady Park, near Epsom.

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There's no right to take away my character.

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Our character's the same to me as any lady's.

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't know whether you've noticed it,

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
but the rain stopped about two minutes ago.

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So it has. Why didn't you say so before?

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And us losing our timelessness.

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So long, teacher.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's quite fine now, Clara.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We can walk to a motorboat.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But a cab!

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How tiresome.

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How do you do it, if I may ask?

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Simply phonetics.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The science of speech.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's my profession. Also my hobby.

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Happy is the man who can make a living by his hobby.

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can spot an Irishman or a Yorkshireman by his brogue.

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I can place any man within six miles.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I can place him within two miles in London,

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
sometimes within two streets.

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He'll be ashamed of himself, our manly coward.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But is there a living in that?

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh, yes. Quite a fat one.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is an age of upstarts.

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Men begin in Kentish Town with £80 a year

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and end in Park Lane with £100,000.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They want to drop Kentish Town,

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
but they give themselves away every time they open their mouths.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now, I can teach them...

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let him mind his own business and leave the poor girl!

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Silence!

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is a testable! Go away instantly!

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Or I'll seek the shelter of some other place of worship.

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have a right to be here if I like.

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Same as you!

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A woman who utters such depressing and disgusting sounds

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
has no right to be anywhere.

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No right to live.

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Remember that you are a human being with a soul

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and the divine gift of articulate speech.

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That your native language is the language of Shakespeare

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and Milton and the Bible.

165
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And don't sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon!

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh!

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh, heavens, what a sound!

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ow!

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You see this creature with her curbstone English,

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
the English that will keep her in the gutter

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
to the end of her days.

172
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, sir, in three months,

173
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I could pass that girl off as a duchess

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
at an ambassador's garden party.

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I could even get her a place as ladies' maid or shop assistant,

176
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
which requires better English.

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's the sort of thing I do for commercial millionaires.

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And on the profits of it,

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I do genuine scientific work in phonetics.

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And a little as a poet on Miltonic lines.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is that you say?

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes, you squashed cabbage leaf!

183
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You disgrace to the noble architecture of Covent Garden!

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You incarnate insult to the English language!

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I could pass you off as the Queen of Sheba.

186
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Can you believe that?

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, of course I can.

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I am myself a student of Indian dialects and...

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Are you?

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you know Colonel Pickering,

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the author of Spoken Sanskrit?

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I am Colonel Pickering.

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Who are you?

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Henry Higgins, author of Higgins' Universal Alphabet.

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I came from India to meet you.

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I was going to India to meet you.

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Where do you live?

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
27A Wimpole Street. Come and see me tomorrow.

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, I'm at the Carlton.

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Come with me now and let's have a joy over some supper.

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Right you are.

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Bye-bye, flower-kind gentleman.

203
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sure for me lodging.

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I really haven't any change. I'm sorry.

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Take the old blooming basket for sixpence.

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
A reminder.

207
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There.

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thank you, Pickering.

209
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Got one at last.

210
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, hello.

211
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Where are the two ladies that were here?

212
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They walked to the bus when the rain stopped.

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And left me with a cab on my hands.

214
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Damnation.

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Never you mind, young man.

216
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm going home in a taxi.

217
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You sure you've got the fare, Judy?

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Right you are, then.

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Goodbye, Freddy. Don't let me keep you standing there.

220
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Goodbye.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Goodbye.

222
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Where to?

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Angel Court, Drury Lane.

224
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Next to Mickle John's oil shop.

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Right you are.

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Aye. Aye. Aye.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

228
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, I think that's the whole show.

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's really amazing.

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I haven't taken half of it in, you know.

231
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Would you like to go over any of it again?

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No, no, thank you. Not now.

233
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm quite done up for this morning.

234
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I rather fancy myself because I can pronounce 24 distinct vowel sounds,

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
but your 130 beat me.

236
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I can't hear a bit of difference between most of them.

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Oh, that comes with practice.

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You hear no difference at first, but you keep on listening,

239
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and presently you'll find they're all as different as A from B.

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What's the matter?

241
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
A young woman wants to see you, sir.

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Young woman? What does she want?

243
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, sir, she says you'll be glad to see her when you know what she's come about.

244
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
She's quite a common girl, sir.

245
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Very common indeed.

246
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I should have sent her away,

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
only I thought perhaps you wanted her to talk into your machines.

248
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Has she an interesting accent?

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, something dreadful, sir, really.

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't know how you can take an interest in it.

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's have her up. Show her up, Mrs Pierce.

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Very well, sir. It's for you to say.

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, this is rather a bit of luck.

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll show you how I make records.

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We'll set her talking, and I'll take it down first in Bell's visible speech,

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
then in broad rhomic, and then we'll get her on the phonograph

257
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
so that you can turn her on as often as you like

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
with the written transcript before you.

259
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is the young woman, sir.

260
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why, this is the girl I jotted down last night.

261
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, she's no use.

262
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I've got all the records I want of the Liston Grove lingo,

263
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and I'm not going to waste another cylinder on it.

264
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Be off with you. I don't want you.

265
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Don't you be so saucy.

266
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You ain't heard what I come for yet.

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Did you tell him I'd come in a taxi?

268
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Nonsense, girl.

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What do you think a gentleman like Mr Higgins cares what you came in?

270
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh, we are proud.

271
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He ain't above giving lessons, not him.

272
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I heard him say so.

273
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Well, I ain't come here to ask for any compliment,

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and if my money's not good enough, I can go elsewhere.

275
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Er, good enough for what?

276
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Good enough for you.

277
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Now you know, don't you?

278
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I've come to have lessons, I am, and to pay for them too.

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Make no mistake.

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Well, what do you expect me to say?

281
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, if you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit down, I think.

282
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Don't I tell you I'm bringing you business?

283
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Pickering.

284
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Shall we ask this baggage to sit down,

285
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
or shall we throw her out of the window?

286
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh!

287
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I won't be called a baggage when I'm offered to pay like any lady.

288
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What is it you want, my girl?

289
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, I want to be a lady in a flower shop

290
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
instead of selling at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.

291
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But they won't take me unless I can talk more genteel.

292
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He said he could teach me.

293
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Well, here I am, ready to pay him, not asking any favour,

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and he treats me as if I was dirt.

295
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
How can you be such a foolish, ignorant girl

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
as to think you could afford to pay Mr Higgins?

297
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Why, shouldn't I?

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I know what lessons cost as well as you do, and I'm ready to pay.

299
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
How much?

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now you're talking.

301
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I thought you'd come off it when you saw a chance of getting back

302
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
a bit of what you chucked at me last night.

303
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You'd had a drop in, hadn't you?

304
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Sit down.

305
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, if you're going to make a compliment of it.

306
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Sit down.

307
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

308
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No!

309
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Won't you sit down?

310
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Don't mind if I do.

311
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What's your name?

312
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Liza Doolittle.

313
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Very well.

314
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And how much do you propose to pay me for the lessons, Liza?

315
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, I know what's right.

316
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
A lady friend of mine gets French lessons for 18 pence an hour

317
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
from a real French gentleman.

318
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, you wouldn't have the face to ask me the same

319
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
for teaching me my own language as you would for French,

320
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
so I won't give more than a shilling.

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Take it or leave it.

322
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You know, Pickering, if you consider a shilling

323
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
not as a simple shilling but as a percentage of this girl's income,

324
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
it works out as fully equivalent to 60 or 70 pounds for a millionaire.

325
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
By George, it's enormous.

326
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's the biggest offer I ever had.

327
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
60 pounds?

328
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What are you talking about? I never offered you 60 pounds.

329
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Hold your tongue!

330
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
My God, 60 pounds!

331
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't cry, you silly girl. Sit down.

332
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Nobody's going to touch your money.

333
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Somebody's going to touch you with a broomstick

334
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
if you don't stop snivelling. Sit down.

335
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh! One would think you was my father.

336
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If I decide to teach you, I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

337
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Here.

338
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What's this for?

339
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
To wipe your eyes.

340
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
To wipe any part of your face that feels moist.

341
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Remember, that's your handkerchief.

342
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's your sleeve.

343
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Don't mistake the one for the other if you wish to become a lady in a shop.

344
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Higgins, I'm interested.

345
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What about the ambassador's garden party?

346
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive if you make that good.

347
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll bet you all the expense of the experiment, you can't do it.

348
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And I'll pay for the lessons.

349
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, you are a real good thing, you captain.

350
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's almost irresistible.

351
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
She's so deliciously low.

352
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So horribly dirty.

353
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I ain't dirty.

354
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I washed my face and hands before I come, I did.

355
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What is life but a series of inspired follies?

356
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The difficulty is to find them to do.

357
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I shall make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

358
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes, in six months, in three, if she has a good ear and a quick tongue,

359
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll take her anywhere and pass her off as anything.

360
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We'll start today.

361
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Now, this moment, take her away and clean her, Mrs Pearce.

362
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Monkey brand if it won't come off any other way.

363
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Is there a good fire in the kitchen?

364
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes, but...

365
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Take all her clothes off and burn them.

366
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Ring up Whitefield, somebody, for new ones.

367
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Wrap her up in brown paper till they come.

368
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You're no gentleman, you're not, to talk of such things.

369
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm a good girl, I am.

370
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And I know what the like of you are, I do.

371
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We want none of your Listengrove prudery here, young woman.

372
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You've got to learn to behave like a duchess.

373
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Take her away, Mrs Pearce.

374
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

375
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No, I'll call a place, I will, but I've no place to put her.

376
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Put her in the dustbin.

377
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
No!

378
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh, come, Higgins, be reasonable.

379
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You must be reasonable, Mr Higgins, really you must.

380
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You can't walk over everybody like this.

381
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I walk over everybody?

382
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
My dear Mrs Pearce, my dear Pickering,

383
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I never had the slightest intention of walking over anyone.

384
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
All I propose is that we should be kind to this poor girl.

385
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
We must help her to prepare and fit herself for her new station in life.

386
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Sir, you can't take a girl up like that,

387
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
as if you were picking up a pebble on a beach.

388
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Why not?

389
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Why not?

390
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But you don't know anything about her.

391
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What about her parents?

392
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
She may be married.

393
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Gone!

394
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes, as the girl very properly says, gone.

395
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Don't you know that a woman of that class looks a worn-out drudge of 50

396
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
a year after she's married?

397
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Who'd marry me?

398
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
By George, Eliza, the streets will be strewn with the bodies of men

399
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
shooting themselves for your sake before I've done with you.

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Nonsense, sir.

401
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You mustn't talk like that to her.

402
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm going away.

403
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He's off his chump, he is.

404
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't want a lot of barbies teaching me.

405
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh, indeed.

406
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm mad, am I?

407
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Very well, Mrs Pearce, you needn't order the new clothes for her.

408
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Throw her out.

409
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Come along.

410
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
No!

411
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You've got no right to touch me.

412
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You see now what comes of being saucy.

413
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
This way, please.

414
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I didn't want no clothes.

415
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I wouldn't have taken them.

416
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I can buy me own clothes.

417
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You're an ungrateful, wicked girl.

418
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is my return for offering to take you out of the gutter

419
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and dress you beautifully and make a lady of you.

420
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Stop, Mr Higgins, I won't allow it.

421
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's you that are wicked.

422
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Go home to your parents, girl, and tell them to take better care of you.

423
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I ain't got no parents.

424
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
They told me I was big enough to earn me own living and turn me out.

425
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Well, where's your mother?

426
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I ain't got no mother.

427
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, that turned me out was my sixth stepmother,

428
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
but I done without them, and I'm a good girl, I am.

429
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Very well, then, what on earth is all this fuss about?

430
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The girl doesn't belong to anybody.

431
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
There's no use to anybody but me.

432
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But what's to become of her?

433
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Is she to be paid anything?

434
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, do be sensible, sir.

435
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
She'll have her food and her clothes.

436
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
She'll only drink if you give her money.

437
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You are a brute. It's a lie.

438
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Nobody ever saw the sign of liquor on me.

439
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Does it occur to you, Higgins, that the girl has some feelings?

440
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, no, I don't think so.

441
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Not any feelings that we need bother about.

442
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Have you, Eliza?

443
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, you've no feeling heart in you.

444
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You don't care for nothing but yourself.

445
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Here, I've had enough of this. I'm going.

446
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Have some chocolates, Eliza.

447
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
How do I know what might be in them?

448
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I've never heard of girls being drugged by the like of you.

449
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Pledge of good faith, Eliza.

450
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I eat one half.

451
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You eat the other.

452
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Mmm.

453
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Oh, mmm.

454
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You shall have boxes of them,

455
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
barrels of them every day.

456
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You shall live on them.

457
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Mmm?

458
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I wouldn't have ate it, only I'm too lazy to take it out of my mouth.

459
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Listen, Eliza.

460
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You said you came in a taxi.

461
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What if I did?

462
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I was as good a ride to take a taxi as anyone else.

463
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, you have, Eliza.

464
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And in future, you shall have as many taxis as you want.

465
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You shall go up and down and round the town in a taxi every day.

466
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Think of that, Eliza.

467
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Mr Higgins, you're tempting the girl.

468
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's not right.

469
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And you shall marry an officer in the guards

470
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
with a beautiful moustache, the son of a marquis...

471
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Excuse me, Higgins, but Mrs Pierce is quite right.

472
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
If this girl is to put herself in your hands for six months

473
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
for an experiment in teaching,

474
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
she must understand thoroughly what she's doing.

475
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Well, how can she? She's incapable of understanding anything.

476
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Besides, do any of us understand what we're doing?

477
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
If we did, would we ever do it?

478
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Very clever, Higgins, but not sound sense.

479
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Miss Doolittle.

480
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There, that's all you'll get out of Eliza.

481
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No use explaining.

482
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
As a military man, you ought to know that.

483
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
She orders. That's what she wants.

484
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Eliza, you are to live here for the next six months,

485
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
learning how to speak beautifully like a lady in a florist's shop.

486
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If you're good and do whatever you're told,

487
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
you shall sleep in a proper bedroom and have lots to eat

488
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.

489
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If you're naughty and idle, you will sleep in the back kitchen

490
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
among the black beetles and be wallowed by Mrs Pierce with a broomstick.

491
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
At the end of six months,

492
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
you shall go to Buckingham Palace

493
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

494
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If the king finds out that you're not a lady,

495
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you'll be taken by the police to the Tower of London,

496
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
where your head will be cut off as a warning to other presumptuous flower girls.

497
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
If you are not found out,

498
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
you shall have a present of seven and sixpence

499
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
to start life with as a lady in a shop.

500
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If you refuse this offer, you will be a most ungrateful, wicked girl,

501
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and the angels will weep for you.

502
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Now are you satisfied, Pickering?

503
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Can I put it more plainly and fairly, Mrs Pierce?

504
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I think you'd better let me speak to the girl properly, in private.

505
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Come with me, Eliza.

506
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Thank you, Mrs Pierce.

507
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Bandler off to the bathroom.

508
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You're a great bully, you are.

509
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I won't stay here if I don't like.

510
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I won't let nobody wallop me.

511
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I never asked to go to Buckingham Palace, so I didn't.

512
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I was never in trouble with the police, not me.

513
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm a good girl.

514
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Don't answer back, girl.

515
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You don't understand the gentleman.

516
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Come with me.

517
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Well, what I say is right.

518
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I won't go near the king,

519
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
not if I'm going to have my head cut off.

520
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
If I'd known what I was hitting myself in for,

521
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I wouldn't have come here.

522
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I've always been a good girl,

523
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and I never offered to say a word to him.

524
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And I don't owe him nothing, and I don't care,

525
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and I won't be brought upon,

526
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and I have me feelings the same as anyone else.

527
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I will have to put you in here.

528
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This will be your bedroom.

529
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh!

530
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh, I couldn't sleep here, Mrs.

531
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's too good for the likes of me.

532
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I should be afraid to touch anything.

533
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I ain't a duchess yet, you know.

534
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You have got to make yourself as clean as the room.

535
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Then you won't be afraid of it.

536
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And you must call me Mrs. Pierce, not Mrs.

537
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, what's this?

538
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Is this where you wash clothes?

539
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Funny sort of copper, I'll call it.

540
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's not a copper.

541
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza,

542
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and where I'm going to wash you.

543
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You expect me to get into that and wet myself all over?

544
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Not me. I should catch my death.

545
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I knew a woman did it every Saturday night,

546
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and she died of it.

547
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Mr. Higgins has the gentleman's bathroom downstairs,

548
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and he has a bath every morning in cold water.

549
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Oh, he's made of iron, that man.

550
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
If you are to sit with him and the Colonel and be taught,

551
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
you will have to do the same.

552
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
They won't like the smell of you if you don't,

553
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
but you can have the water as hot as you like.

554
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
There are two taps, hot and cold.

555
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I couldn't. It's not natural.

556
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It'll kill me.

557
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I've never had a bath in my life,

558
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
nor will you call a proper one.

559
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Don't you want to be clean and sweet and decent like a lady?

560
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You know you can't be a nice girl inside if you're a dirty slut outside.

561
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Oh, now stop crying and go back into your room

562
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and take off all your clothes.

563
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Then wrap yourself in this and come back to me.

564
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I will get the bath ready.

565
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I can't. I won't. I'm not used to it.

566
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I've never took off all my clothes before.

567
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's not right. It's not decent.

568
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Nonsense, child.

569
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Don't you take off all your clothes every night when you go to bed?

570
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
No. Why should I?

571
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I should catch my death.

572
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Of course I take off my skirt.

573
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Do you mean that you sleep in the underclothes you wear in the daytime?

574
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What else have I to sleep in?

575
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You will never do that again as long as you live here.

576
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I will get you a proper nightdress.

577
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Do you mean changing to cold things and lie awake shivering all night?

578
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You want to kill me, you do.

579
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You don't know what a cold is to me.

580
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You don't know how I dread it.

581
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Your bed won't be cold here.

582
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I will put a hot water bottle into it.

583
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Off with you and undress.

584
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Oh!

585
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
If only I'd known what a dreadful thing it is to be clean.

586
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'd never have come.

587
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I don't know when I was well off.

588
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Now, come along.

589
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Take that thing off.

590
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Oh, I couldn't, Mrs Beers. Really, I couldn't.

591
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I've never done such a thing.

592
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Nonsense. Here, step in and tell me whether it's hot enough for you.

593
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Oh!

594
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh, it's too hot.

595
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Oh, it won't hurt you.

596
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
There, do you see how much better that feels?

597
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh, it's horrible.

598
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It feels like to be a horse.

599
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh, I'm going to get you.

600
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Excuse the straight question, Meggins.

601
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Are you a man of good character where women are concerned?

602
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?

603
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yes, very frequently.

604
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, I haven't.

605
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I find that the moment I let a woman make friends with me,

606
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
she becomes jealous, exacting, suspicious and a damn nuisance.

607
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I find that the moment I let myself make friends with a woman,

608
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I become selfish and tyrannical.

609
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh, women upset everything.

610
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor and likely to remain so.

611
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
When you let a woman in your life...

612
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Come, Higgins, you know what I mean.

613
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
If I'm to be in this business, I shall feel responsible for that girl.

614
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I hope it's understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position.

615
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What? That thing? Oh, sacred.

616
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I assure you.

617
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You see, she'll be a pupil,

618
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and teaching would be impossible unless pupils were sacred.

619
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I've taught scores of American millionaireesses how to speak English,

620
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
the best-looking women in the world.

621
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm seasoned.

622
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
They might as well be blocks of wood.

623
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I might as well be a block of wood.

624
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
No, it's really...

625
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Well, Mrs Pearce, is it all right?

626
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I just wish to trouble you with a word, if I may, Mr Higgins.

627
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yes, certainly. Come in.

628
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Am I in the way?

629
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Not at all, sir.

630
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Mr Higgins, will you please be very particular what you say before the girl?

631
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Well, of course.

632
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm always particular about what I say.

633
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Why do you say this to me?

634
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
No, sir, you're not at all particular when you've mislaid anything

635
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
or when you get a little impatient.

636
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Now, it doesn't matter before me.

637
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm used to it.

638
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But you really must not swear before the girl.

639
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I swear? I never swear.

640
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I detest the habit.

641
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
What the devil do you mean?

642
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That's what I mean, sir.

643
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You swear a great deal too much.

644
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Now, I don't mind you damning and blasting.

645
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And what the devil?

646
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And where the devil?

647
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And who the devil?

648
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Really, Mrs Pearce, there's language from your lips.

649
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But there is a certain word I must ask you not to use.

650
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The girl used it herself because the bath was too hot.

651
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It begins with the same letter as bath.

652
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Now, she knows no better.

653
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
She learned it at her mother's knee.

654
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But she must not hear it from your lips.

655
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I cannot charge myself with having ever uttered it, Mrs Pearce.

656
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Except perhaps in a moment of extreme, unjustifiable excitement.

657
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Only this morning, sir.

658
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You applied it to your boots, to the butter, and to the brown bread.

659
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
That was a mere alliteration, Mrs Pearce.

660
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Natural to a poet.

661
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, sir, whatever you choose to call it, I beg you not to let the girl hear you repeat it.

662
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh, very well, very well. Is that all?

663
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
No, sir.

664
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We shall have to be very particular with this girl as to personal cleanliness.

665
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh, certainly. Quite right. Most important.

666
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I mean not to be slovenly about her dress or untidy in leaving things about.

667
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Yes, just there. I intended to call your attention to that.

668
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It is these little things that matter, Pickering.

669
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes, sir.

670
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Then might I ask you not to come down to breakfast in your dressing gown.

671
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Or at any rate, not to use it as a napkin to the extent you do, sir.

672
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And if you would be so good as to not eat everything off the same plate.

673
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And to remember not to put the porridge saucepan out of your hand on the clean tablecloth.

674
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It would be a better example to the girl.

675
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You know you nearly choked yourself with a fishbone in the jam only last week.

676
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You're quite right, Mrs. Pearce. I shall be particularly careful before the girl. Is that all?

677
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
No, sir.

678
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Might you use some of those Japanese dresses you bought from abroad?

679
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I really can't put her back in her old things.

680
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Certainly. Anything you'd like. Is that all?

681
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Thank you, sir. That's all.

682
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You know, Pickering, that woman has the most extraordinary ideas about me.

683
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Here I am, a shy, diffident sort of man,

684
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and yet she is firmly persuaded that I'm an arbitrary, overbearing, bossing kind of person.

685
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I can't account for it.

686
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
If you please, sir. The trouble's beginning already.

687
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
There's a dustman downstairs.

688
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Alfred Doolittle wants to see you.

689
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
He says you have his daughter here.

690
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I say, send the blaggard up.

691
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Very well, sir.

692
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
He may not be a blaggard, I guess.

693
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Nonsense. Of course he's a blaggard.

694
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Well, whether he is or not, I'm afraid we shall have some trouble with him.

695
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh, no, I think not. If there's any trouble, he shall have it with me, not I with him.

696
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And we're sure to get something interesting out of him.

697
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
About the girl?

698
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
No, no. I mean his dialect.

699
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Oh.

700
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Doolittle, sir.

701
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Professor Higgins?

702
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Here. Good morning. Sit down.

703
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Morning, Governor.

704
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Morning.

705
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Gentlemen, I come about a very serious matter.

706
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Brought up in Hounslow. Mother, Welsh, I should think.

707
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
What do you want, Doolittle?

708
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I want my daughter. That's what I want. See?

709
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Well, of course you do. You're her father, aren't you?

710
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm glad to see you have some spark of family feeling left.

711
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
She's upstairs. Take her away at once.

712
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
What?

713
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Take her away.

714
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Do you suppose I'm going to keep your daughter for you?

715
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Now, now. Look here, Governor.

716
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Is this reasonable? Is it fair to take advantage of her?



1
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
a man like this. The girl belongs to me. You got her. Where do I come in?

2
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,240
Your daughter had the audacity to come to my house and ask me to teach her how to speak

3
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,000
properly so that she could get a place in a flower shop. This gentleman and my housekeeper

4
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,440
have been here all the time. How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me? You

5
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,879
sent her here on purpose. No, governor. This is a plot. A plot to extort money by threats.

6
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:29,879
That's your telephone for the police. Have I asked you for a brass farthing? I'll leave

7
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:34,880
it to the gentleman here. Have I said a word about money? What else did you come for? I'll

8
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,880
tell you, governor, if you'll only let me get a word in. I'm willing to tell you. I'm

9
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,680
wanting to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you. Pickering, this chap has a certain natural

10
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:53,160
gift of rhetoric. Observe the rhythm of his native Woodnoots wild. I'm willing to tell

11
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:59,160
you. I'm wanting to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you. Sentimental rhetoric. That's

12
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,160
the Welsh string in him. It also accounts for his mendacity and dishonesty. Oh, please,

13
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Higgins, I'm West Country myself. How did you know the girl was here if you didn't send

14
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:14,160
her? It was like this, governor. The girl took a boy in the taxi to give him a jaunt.

15
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Son of a landlady, he is. He hung about on a chance of her giving him another ride home.

16
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Well, she sent him back for her luggage when she heard you was willing for her to stop

17
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:31,160
here. And he told me what was up and that she said she didn't want no clothes. What

18
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:39,160
was I to think from that, governor? I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think? So

19
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:45,160
you came to rescue her from worse than death, eh? Just so, governor. That's right. But why

20
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,160
did you bring her luggage if you intended to take her away? Have I said a word about

21
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,160
taking her away? Have I now? Well, you're going to take her away. Double quick. No,

22
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:00,160
governor. Don't say that. I'm not the man to stand in my girl's light. It's a career

23
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,160
opening for her, as you might say. Ah, Mrs. Pearce, this is Eliza's father. He has come

24
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:11,160
to take her away. Give her to him. No. This is a misunderstanding. Listen here. He can't

25
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:17,160
take her away, Mr. Higgins. How can he? You told me to burn her clothes. That's right.

26
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,160
I can't carry the girl through the streets like a blooming monkey, can I? I put it to

27
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,160
you. You have put it to me that you want your daughter. Take your daughter. If she has no

28
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:31,160
clothes, go out and buy her some. Where's the clothes? She come in. Did I burn them?

29
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:38,160
Did your missus here? I am the housekeeper, if you please. I have sent for some clothes

30
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:44,160
for your girl. When they come, you can take her away. You can wait in the kitchen. This

31
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:51,160
way, please. Listen here, governor. You and me is men of the world, aren't we? Oh, men

32
00:32:51,160 --> 00:33:03,160
of the world, are we? You'd better go, Mrs. Pearce. I think so. Indeed, sir. The floor

33
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:10,160
is yours, Mr. Doolittle. I thank you, governor. Well, the truth is, I've taken a sort of fancy

34
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,160
to you, governor. And if you want a girl, I'm not so set on having her back home again.

35
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:22,160
But what I might be open to, an arrangement. Regarding the life of a young woman, she's

36
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:28,160
a fine, handsome girl. As a daughter, she's not worth her keep. And so I tell you straight,

37
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:35,160
all I ask is my rights as a father. Well, what's a five pound note to you, governor?

38
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,160
And what's Eliza to me? I think you ought to know, Doolittle, that Mr. Higgins' intentions

39
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,160
are entirely honourable. Of course they are, governor. If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask

40
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:51,160
50. Do you mean to say, you callous rascal, that you would sell your daughter for 50 pounds?

41
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Not in a general way I wouldn't, but to oblige a gentleman like you, I'd do a good deal,

42
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,160
I do assure you. Have you no morals, man? Can't afford them, governor. Neither could

43
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,160
you if you was as poor as me. Not that I mean any harm, you know. But if Eliza is going

44
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:13,160
to have a bit out of this, why not me too? Well, I don't know what to do, Pickering.

45
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,160
There can be no question that as a matter of morals, it's a positive crime to give this

46
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:25,160
chap a farthing. Yet I feel a sort of rough justice in his claim. Well, really, it seems

47
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:31,160
hardly right. Don't say that, governor. Don't look at it that way. What am I, governors

48
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:40,160
both? I ask you, what am I? I am one of the undeserving poor. That's what I am. Think

49
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:46,160
of what that means to a man. It means that he's up against middle class morality all

50
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,160
the time. If there's anything going, and I put in for a bit of it, it's always the same

51
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:58,160
story. You're undeserving, so you can't have it. But my needs is as great as the most deserving

52
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,160
widows that ever got money out of six different charities in one week for the death of the

53
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:09,160
same husband. I don't need less than a deserving man. I need more. I don't eat less heartily

54
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:15,160
than him, and I drink a lot more. I want a bit of amusement, because I'm a thinking man.

55
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:21,160
I want cheerfulness and a song and a band when I feel low. Well, they charge me just

56
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:28,160
the same for everything as they charge the deserving. What is middle class morality?

57
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Just an excuse for never giving me anything. I ain't pretending to be deserving. I'm undeserving,

58
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:44,160
and I mean to go on being undeserving. Therefore, I ask you as two gentlemen not to play that

59
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,160
game on me. Will you take advantage of a man's nature to do him out of the price of

60
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,160
his own daughter what he's brought up and fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow until

61
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:02,160
she's grown big enough to be interesting to you two gentlemen? It's five pounds? Unreasonable?

62
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,160
I put it to you, and I leave it to you. Peckering, if we were to take this man in hand for three

63
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,160
months, he could choose between a seat in the cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.

64
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,160
What do you say to that, Doolittle? Not me, Governor. Thank you kindly. I've heard all

65
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,160
the preachers and all the prime ministers, and I'll tell you, it's a dog's life any way

66
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,160
you look at it. Undeserving poverty is my line. I suppose we must give him a fiver.

67
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:33,160
He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid. Not me, Governor. So help me, I won't. Don't you

68
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,160
be afraid that I'll save it and spare it and live idle on it. There won't be a penny of

69
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,160
it left by Monday. I'll have to go to work, same as if I'd never had it. It won't pauperise

70
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:49,160
me, you bet. Just one good spree for myself and the missus, giving pleasure to ourselves,

71
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,160
unemployment to others, and satisfaction to you to think it's not been throwed away. You

72
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,160
couldn't spend it better. This is irresistible. Let's give him ten. No, Governor. She wouldn't

73
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,160
have the heart to spend ten, and perhaps I shouldn't neither. Why don't you marry that

74
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,160
missus of yours? I'd rather draw the line at encouraging that sort of immorality. Tell

75
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,160
her so, Governor. Tell her so. I'm willing. It's me that suffers by it. I've got no hold

76
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,160
on her. I've got to be agreeable to her. I've got to give her presents. I've got to buy

77
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,160
her clothes. Something sinful. I'm a slave to that woman, Governor, just because I'm

78
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:29,160
not a lawful husband. Take my advice, Governor. Marry Eliza while she's young and don't know

79
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,160
better. Pickering, if we listen to this man another minute, we shall have no convictions

80
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,160
left. Five pounds, I think you said. Thank you kindly, Governor. You're sure you won't

81
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:45,160
take ten? Not now. Another time, Governor. Here you are. Thank you, Governor. And good

82
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:53,160
morning. Oh! Beg your pardon, miss. Gone! Don't you know your own daughter? Blimey!

83
00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:00,160
It's Eliza! What's this? By Jove! Well, I never thought she'd clean up as good looking

84
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,160
as that, Governor. She's a credit to me, ain't she? I tell you, it's easy to clean up here.

85
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,160
Hot and cold water on tap, just as much as you like there is. Woolly towels there is.

86
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Soft brushes to scrub yourself and a wooden bowl of soap smelling like primroses. Now

87
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,160
I know why ladies are so clean. Washing's a treat for them. Wish they saw what it is

88
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,160
for the like of me. I'm glad the bathroom met with your approval. It didn't. Not all

89
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:33,159
of it. I don't care who hears me saying, Mrs. Pearce knows. What was wrong, Mrs. Pearce?

90
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:37,159
Oh, nothing, sir. It doesn't matter. I had a good mind to break it. Didn't know which

91
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:44,159
way to look, but hung a towel over it, I did. Over what? Over the looking glass, sir. Ah!

92
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,159
Doolittle, you brought your daughter up too strictly. Me? I never brought her up a choll,

93
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:53,159
except to give her a liquor strap now and again. Don't put it on me, Governor. She ain't

94
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:58,159
accustomed to it, you see. That's all. But she'll soon pick up your free and easy ways.

95
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:04,159
I'm a good girl, I am, and I won't pick up no free and easy ways. Eliza, if you say

96
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,159
again that you are a good girl, your father shall take you home. Not him. You don't know

97
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:13,159
my father. All he come here for was a touch of his money get drunk on. Don't you give

98
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:18,159
me none of your liquor. And don't let me hear you giving this gentleman any of it neither

99
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:25,159
or you'll hear from me about it. See? Afternoon, gentlemen. Afternoon, ma'am.

100
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:33,159
Don't you believe the old liar? You won't see him again in a hurry. He's a disgrace

101
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:38,159
to me, he is, collecting dust instead of working at his trade. What is his trade, Eliza? Oh,

102
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:44,159
his proper trade's an heavy, and he works at it sometimes too. Ain't you going to call

103
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:49,159
me Miss Doolittle anymore? Oh, I beg your pardon, Miss Doolittle. It was a slip of

104
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:56,159
the tongue. Oh, I don't mind, only it sounded so genteel. I should just like to take a taxi

105
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,159
to the corner of Tottenham Court Road and get out there and tell it to wait for me,

106
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:05,159
just to put the girls in their place a bit. I wouldn't speak to him, you know. Better

107
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:10,159
wait till we get you something really fashionable. Oh. Besides, you shouldn't cut your old friends

108
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,159
now that you've risen in the world. That's what we call snobbery. Well, they've took

109
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:19,159
it out of me often enough with their ridicule when they had the chance, and now I mean to

110
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:25,159
get a bit of me own back. But if I'm to have fashionable clothes, I'll wait. Now, Eliza,

111
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:31,159
the new things have come for you to try on. Oh. Oh. Oh, don't rush about like that girl.

112
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:46,159
Pickering, we have taken on a stiff job. Higgins, we have. Say your alphabet. I know my alphabet?

113
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:51,159
Do you think I know nothing? I don't need to be taught like a child. Say your alphabet.

114
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:56,159
Say it, Miss Doolittle. You will understand presently. Do what he tells you and let him

115
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:09,159
teach you in his own way. Oh. Well, if you put it like that. A, B, C, D. Oh, stop. Listen

116
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:15,159
to this, Pickering. This is what we pay for as elementary education. This unfortunate

117
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:21,159
animal has been locked up for nine years in school at our expense to teach her to speak

118
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:33,159
and read the language of Shakespeare and Milton. And the result is A, B, C, D. Say A, B, C, D.

119
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:46,159
But I'm saying it. A, B, C. Stop. No. Say a cup of tea. A cup of tea. Put your tongue

120
00:41:46,159 --> 00:42:01,159
forward until it squeezes against the top of your lower teeth. Now say cup. I can't. Cup.

121
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:06,159
Good. Splendid, Miss Doolittle. Why, Jupiter, she's done it at the first shot. Pickering,

122
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:12,159
we shall make a duchess of her. Now, do you think you could possibly say tea? Not tie,

123
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:17,159
if you ever say A, B, C, D again, you should be dragged around the room three times by

124
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:23,159
the hair of your head. Tea, tea, tea, tea. I can't hear no difference except it sounds

125
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:28,159
more genteel like when you say it. Well, if you can hear that difference, what the devil

126
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:36,159
are you crying for? Be off with you to Mrs. Pierce and tell her about it. Another lesson

127
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:24,159
of, of, of tea, tea, tea. The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. Henry, what are

128
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:30,159
you doing here today? It's my at-home day. You promised not to come. Go home at once.

129
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:37,159
I know, Mother. I came on purpose. But you mustn't. I'm serious, Henry. You offend all

130
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:43,159
my friends. They stop coming whenever they meet you. Oh, nonsense. I know I have no small

131
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:49,159
talk, but people don't mind. Oh, don't they? Small talk indeed. What about your large talk?

132
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:55,159
Really, dear, you mustn't stay. I must. I have a job for you. A phonetic job. I've picked

133
00:43:55,159 --> 00:44:00,159
up a girl. Does that mean the tam girl has picked you up? Not at all. I don't mean a

134
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:06,159
love affair. What a pity. I can't be bothered with young women. My idea of a lovable woman

135
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:12,159
is somebody as like you as possible. Tell me about the girl. She's coming to see you.

136
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:17,159
I don't remember asking her. No, you didn't. I asked her. If you'd known her, you wouldn't

137
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:25,159
have asked her. Indeed? Why? Well, it's like this. She's a common flower girl. I picked

138
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:31,159
her off the curb stove. And invited her to my at-home? Oh, that'll be all right. I've

139
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:36,159
taught her to speak properly and she has strict orders as to her behaviour. She's to keep

140
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:41,159
to two subjects, the weather and everybody's health. Fine day and how do you do, you know,

141
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:47,159
and not to let herself go on things in general. Yes, that will be safe. Safe? To talk about

142
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:53,159
our health and our insides? Perhaps about our outsides? How could you be so silly, Henry?

143
00:44:53,159 --> 00:45:00,159
Well, she must talk about something. Oh, she'll be all right. Don't you fuss. Pickering is

144
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:05,159
in it with me. I've a sort of bet on that I'll pass her off as a duchess in six months.

145
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:10,159
I started on her some months ago and oh, she's getting on like a house on fire. I shall win

146
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:15,159
my bet. She has a quick ear and she's been easier to teach than my middle class pupils

147
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:20,159
because she's had to learn a complete new language. She talks English almost as you

148
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:27,159
talk French. That's satisfactory at all events. Well, it is and it isn't. What does that mean?

149
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:33,159
You see, I've got her pronunciation all right, but you have to consider not only how a girl

150
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:38,159
pronounces, but what she pronounces. And that's where I want your...

151
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:43,159
Mrs and Miss Einsford-Hill. Oh, Lord!

152
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:51,159
How do you do? How do you do? My son, Henry. Your celebrated son. I have so long to meet

153
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:57,159
you, Professor Higgins. Delighted. How do you do? Well, I've seen you before somewhere.

154
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:04,159
I haven't a ghost of a notion of where, but I've heard your voice. Er, it doesn't matter.

155
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:10,159
You'd better sit down. I'm sorry to say that my celebrated son has no manners. You mustn't

156
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:17,159
mind him. I don't. Have I been rude? I didn't mean to be. Colonel Pickering. How do you

157
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:24,159
do, Mrs Higgins? So glad you've come. Do you know Mrs Einsford-Hill? Miss Einsford-Hill?

158
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:29,159
Has Henry told you what we've come for? We were interrupted, damn it! Oh, Henry, Henry,

159
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:36,159
really? Are we in the way? No, no. You couldn't have come more fortunately. We want you to

160
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:44,159
meet a friend of ours. Yes, by chort. Er, we want two or three people. Er, you'll do

161
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:50,159
as well as anybody else. Mr Einsford-Hill. God of heaven, another of them. How do you

162
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:56,159
do? Very good of you to come. Colonel Pickering. How do you do? I don't think you know my son,

163
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:03,159
Professor Higgins. How do you do? Well, take my oath I've met you before somewhere. Where

164
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:07,160
was it? I don't think so. It don't matter anyhow. Er, sit down.

165
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:25,160
Well, here we are. Anyhow. And now what the devil are we going to talk about until Eliza

166
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:30,160
comes? Henry, you are the life and soul of the Royal Society's soirees, but really you're

167
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,160
rather trying on more commonplace occasions. Am I? Oh, very sorry. I suppose I am, you

168
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:43,160
know. I sympathise. I haven't any small talk. If people would only be frank and say what

169
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:48,160
they really think. Oh, Lord forbid. But why? What they think they ought to think is bad

170
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:53,160
enough, Lord knows. But what they really think would break up the whole show. You see, we're

171
00:47:53,160 --> 00:48:05,160
all savages, more or less. Henry. Miss Doolittle. Here she is, Mother. How do you do, Mrs Higgins?

172
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:14,160
Mr Higgins told me I might come. Quite right. I'm very glad indeed to see you. How do you

173
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:21,160
do, Miss Doolittle? Colonel Pickering, is it not? I feel sure we've met before, Miss

174
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:30,160
Doolittle. I remember your eyes. How do you do? My daughter, Clara. How do you do? How

175
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:37,160
do you do? I've certainly had the pleasure. My son, Freddie. How do you do? By George,

176
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:47,160
yes, it all comes back to me. Covered garden. What a damn thing. Henry, please. Sorry. Will

177
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:55,160
it rain, do you think? The shallow depression in the west of these islands is likely to

178
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:02,160
move slowly in an easterly direction. There are no indications of any great change in

179
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:10,160
the barometrical situation. How awfully funny. What is wrong with that, young man? I bet

180
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:17,160
I got it right. Killing. I'm sure I hope it won't turn cold. There's so much influenza

181
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:25,160
about. It runs right through our whole family regularly every spring. My aunt died of influenza,

182
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:32,160
so they said. Goodness. But it's my belief they'd done the old woman in. Done her in?

183
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:40,160
Yes. Lord love you. Why should she die of influenza? She'd come through diphtheria

184
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:48,160
right enough the year before. I saw her with my own eyes. Fairly blue with it, she was.

185
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:54,160
They all thought she was dead. But my father, he kept ladling gin down her throat till she

186
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:01,160
came to so sudden that she bit the bowl off the spoon. What call would a woman with that

187
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:08,160
strength in her have to die of influenza? What become of her new straw hat that should

188
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:15,160
have come to me? Somebody pinched it. And what I say is, them has pinched it, done her

189
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:22,160
in. What does doing her in mean? Oh, that's the new small talk. To do a person in means

190
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:28,160
to kill them. You surely don't believe that your aunt was killed. Do I not? Them she lived

191
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:35,160
with would have killed her for a hat pin, let alone a hat. But it can't have been right

192
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:41,160
for your father to pour spirits down her throat like that. It might have killed her.

193
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:49,160
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her. Besides, he'd poured so much down his own throat that

194
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:57,160
he knew the good of it. Do you mean that he drank? Drank? My word, something chronic.

195
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:05,160
How dreadful for you. Not a bit. It never did him no harm what I could see. But then

196
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:11,160
he did not keep it up regular. And always more agreeable when he had a drop in. There's

197
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:18,160
lots of women has to make their husbands drunk to make them fit to live with. Here, what

198
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:26,160
are you sniggering at? Oh, the new small talk. You do it so awfully well. If I was doing

199
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:34,160
it proper, what was you laughing at? Have I said anything I want? Not at all, Miss Dolittle.

200
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:47,160
Well, that's a mercy. Anyhow, what I always say is... Well, I must go. So pleased to have

201
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:55,160
met you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, Colonel Pickering. Goodbye, Miss Dolittle. Goodbye,

202
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:03,160
all. Are you walking across the park, Miss Dolittle? If so... Walk? Not bloody likely.

203
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:22,160
I am going in a taxi. I really can't get used to the new ways. Oh, it's all right, Mama.

204
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,160
People will think we never go anywhere or see anybody if you are so old-fashioned. I

205
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:32,160
dare say I am very old-fashioned. But I do hope you won't begin using that expression,

206
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:38,160
Clara. Well, I find the new small talk delightful and quite innocent. Well, after that, I think

207
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:44,160
it's time for us to go. Oh, yes. We have three at-homes to go to still. Goodbye, Mrs. Higgins.

208
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,160
Goodbye, Colonel Pickering. Goodbye. Professor Higgins. Yes, goodbye. Oh, be sure you try

209
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:55,160
on that small talk at the three at-homes. Don't be nervous about it. Pitch it in strong.

210
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:02,160
I will. Goodbye. Such nonsense, all this early Victorian broodery. Oh, such damned nonsense.

211
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:17,160
Such bloody nonsense. Well, goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Would you like to meet Miss Dolittle

212
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:26,160
again? Oh, yes, I should. Most awfully. Well, you know my days. Yes. Um, thanks awfully.

213
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:38,160
Goodbye. Well, is Eliza presentable? You silly boy, of course she's not presentable. She's

214
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,160
a triumph of your art and of her dressmakers. But if you suppose for a moment that she doesn't

215
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:48,160
give herself away in every sentence she utters, you must be perfectly cracked about her. But

216
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,160
don't you think something might be done? I mean, something to eliminate the sanguinary

217
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,160
element from her conversation? Not as long as she's in Henry's hands. Oh, well, I suppose

218
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:03,160
I don't always talk like a bishop. Colonel Pickering, will you tell me what is the exact

219
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:09,160
state of things in Wimpole Street? Where does this girl live? Oh, with us, of course. Where

220
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:17,160
would she live? But on what terms? Is she a servant? If not, what is she? I think I

221
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,160
know what you mean, Mrs Higgins. Well, dash me if I do. I've had to work at the girl

222
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:28,160
every day for months to get her to her present pitch. Besides, she's useful. She knows where

223
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,160
my things are and remembers my appointments and so forth. How does your housekeeper get

224
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,160
on with her? Mrs Pierce? Oh, well, she's got some silly bee in her bonnet about Eliza.

225
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:43,160
She keeps saying, you don't tink, sir. Doesn't she, Pick? Yes, that's the formula. You don't

226
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,160
tink, sir. That's the end of every conversation about Eliza. As if I ever stopped thinking

227
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:53,160
about the girl and her confounded vowels and consonants. Oh, I'm worn out thinking about

228
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,160
her and watching her lips and her teeth and her tongue. Not to mention her soul, which

229
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:04,160
is the quaintest of the lot. You certainly are a pretty pair of babies playing with your

230
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:10,160
live doll. Playing? The hardest job I ever tackled, Mother. Make no mistake about that.

231
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:17,160
But you have no idea how frightfully interesting it is to take a human being and change her

232
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,160
into a quite different human being by creating a new speech for her. It's filling up the

233
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:28,160
deepest gulf that separates class from class and soul from soul. Yes, it's enormously interesting,

234
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,160
I assure you, Mrs Higgins. We take Eliza very seriously. We keep records of every stage,

235
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:38,160
dozens of gramophone discs and photographs. Yes, by George, it's the most absorbing experiment

236
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,160
I ever tackled. She regularly fills our lives up, doesn't she, Pick? We're always talking

237
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:48,160
Eliza. Teaching Eliza. Dressing Eliza. What? Inventing new Elizas. You know, she has the

238
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,160
most extraordinary quickness of ear. I assure you, Mrs Higgins, that girl... Be quiet, Henry.

239
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:59,160
Colonel Pickering, don't you realise that when Eliza walked into Wimpole Street, something

240
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:04,160
walked in with her? The problem of how to pass her off as a lady? I'll solve that problem.

241
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:13,160
I've half solved it already. No, you two infinitely stupid male creatures. The problem of what

242
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:19,160
is to be done with her afterwards. I don't see anything in that. She can go her own way

243
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:24,160
with all the advantages I've given her. She's happy enough. Don't you worry about her. Goodbye.

244
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,160
Anyhow, there's no good bothering now that the thing's done. Goodbye, Mother. There are

245
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,160
plenty of openings. We'll do what's right. Goodbye. Let's take her to the Shakespeare

246
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:37,160
exhibition at Earls Court. Yes, let's. Her remarks will be delicious. She'll mimic all

247
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:44,160
the people for us when we get her. Men! Men! Men!

248
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:14,160
and Mrs Higgins by Sean Phillips. Mrs Eynsford-Hill was played by Georgie Glenn, Clara by Maeve

249
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:21,160
Bluebell-Wells and Freddie by Tom Forrester. All other parts were played by David Sturzaker,

250
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:28,160
David Stern and John Dougal. Pygmalion was adapted and directed for radio by Emma Harding.
