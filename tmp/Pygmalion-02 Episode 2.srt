1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,680
Pygmalion, by me, George Bernard Shaw, Episode 2.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,080
Eliza has not passed as a Duchess yet, and Higgins's bet remains on one.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,240
But the six months are not yet exhausted, and just in time, Eliza does actually pass

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,280
as a Princess.

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:33,080
For a glimpse of how she did it, imagine an embassy in London, one summer evening, after

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
dark.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,759
A grand reception is in progress.

8
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:40,360
A small crowd is lined up to see the guests arrive.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,840
A Rolls-Royce car drives up.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,279
Colonel Pickering, in evening dress, with medals and orders, alights.

11
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:55,639
And hands out Eliza, in opera cloak, evening dress, diamonds, fan, flowers and all accessories.

12
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,639
Higgins follows.

13
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:02,560
The car drives off, and the three go up the steps and into the house, the door opening

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,120
for them as they approach.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,160
One of the guests is an important-looking young man, with an astonishingly hairy face.

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Maestro!

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Maestro!

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,160
Ah, Professor Higgins!

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Mwah!

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Mwah!

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Do you remember me?

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,160
No, I don't.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
Who the devil are you?

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:28,320
I am your pupil, your first pupil, your best and greatest pupil.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,919
I am little Nepomuk, the marvellous boy.

26
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:36,000
I have made your name famous throughout Europe.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,599
You teach me phonetic.

28
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,599
You cannot forget me.

29
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:45,279
Do you know Colonel Pickering, the author of spoken Sanskrit?

30
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,279
Good evening.

31
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,279
Good evening.

32
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,279
Why don't you shave?

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,360
Well, I have not your impulsing appearance, your chin, your brow.

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,239
Nobody noticed me when I shaved.

35
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,480
Now I am famous.

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,959
They call me hairy-faced dick.

37
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,639
And what are you doing here among all these swells?

38
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:06,199
I am interpreter.

39
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,800
I speak thirty-two languages.

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,639
I am indispensable at these international parties.

41
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,119
You are great cockney specialist.

42
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:19,559
You place a man anywhere in London the moment he opens his mouth.

43
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:23,080
I place a man in Europe.

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,839
You are wanted upstairs.

45
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:28,960
Her Excellency cannot understand the Greek, gentlemen.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Thank you.

47
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Yes.

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Immediately.

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,279
This Greek diplomatist pretends he cannot speak or understand English.

50
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,119
He cannot deceive me.

51
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:42,880
He is a son of a Clerkenwell watchmaker.

52
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,240
He speaks English so villainously that he dare not utter a word of it without betraying

53
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
his origin.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:56,080
I help him to pretend, but I make him pay through the nose.

55
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,559
I make them all pay.

56
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,279
Is this fellow really an expert?

57
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:05,039
Can he find out Eliza and blackmail her?

58
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,399
We shall see.

59
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:09,479
If he finds her out, I lose my bet.

60
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,479
Ah, Eliza.

61
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,479
Now for it.

62
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,479
Are you ready?

63
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,479
Are you nervous, Colonel?

64
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,479
Frightfully.

65
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:20,520
I feel exactly as I felt before my first battle.

66
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,520
It's the first time that frightens.

67
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,160
It is not the first time for me, Colonel.

68
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,399
I have done this fifty times, hundreds of times, in my little pickery in Angel Court

69
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,399
in my daydreams.

70
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:35,919
I am in a dream now.

71
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,360
Promise me not to let Professor Higgins wake me.

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,000
For if he does, I shall forget everything and talk as I used to Drury Lane.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Not a word, Higgins.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now, ready?

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ready.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Go.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Miss Doolittle, Colonel Pickering, Professor Higgins.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Miss Doolittle, Colonel Pickering, Professor Higgins.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
How do you do?

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How do you do?

81
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,639
How do you do?

82
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,639
How do you do?

83
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,639
How do you do, Pickering?

84
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,639
How do you do?

85
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,640
Is that your adopted daughter, Colonel Pickering?

86
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,640
She will make a sensation.

87
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Most kind of you to invite her.

88
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Nipamuk, find out all about her.

89
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Excellent.

90
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,640
In the drawing room, the reception is in full swing.

91
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Eliza passes through.

92
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:40,279
She is so intent on her ordeal that she walks like a somnambulist in a desert

93
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,279
instead of a debutante in a fashionable crowd.

94
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,279
They stop talking to look at her.

95
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,279
Eliza is a sensation.

96
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,279
Not a hint of nervousness.

97
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,279
Ah, there is Professor Higgins.

98
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,279
He will tell us.

99
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,279
Tell us about the wonderful young lady, Professor.

100
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,279
What wonderful young lady?

101
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,279
You know very well.

102
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Tell me, there has been nothing like her in London

103
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,920
since people stood on their chairs to look at Mrs. Liontree.

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Ah, there you are at last, Nipamuk.

105
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,920
Have you found out all about the Doolittle lady?

106
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,920
I have found out all about her.

107
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
She is a fraud.

108
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
A fraud?

109
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Oh, no.

110
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Yes, yes.

111
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
She cannot deceive me.

112
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Her name cannot be Doolittle.

113
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Why?

114
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Because Doolittle is an English name and she is not English.

115
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:33,559
Nonsense.

116
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,559
She speaks English perfectly.

117
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:36,559
Too perfectly.

118
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:41,559
Can you show me any Englishwoman who speaks English as it should be spoken?

119
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:46,559
Only foreigners who have been taught to speak it, speak it well.

120
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:49,559
Certainly she terrified me by the way she said, how do you do?

121
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:54,559
I had a schoolmistress who talked like that and I was mortally afraid of her.

122
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,559
But if she is not English, what is she?

123
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,559
Hungarian.

124
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,559
I get it.

125
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Hungarian and of royal blood.

126
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
I am Hungarian.

127
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
My blood is royal.

128
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Did you speak to her in Hungarian?

129
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
I did.

130
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
She was very clever.

131
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
She said, please speak to me in English.

132
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
I do not understand French.

133
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Oh, French.

134
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,200
She pretends not to know the difference between Hungarian and French.

135
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Impossible.

136
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
She knows both.

137
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,200
And the royal blood, how did you find that out?

138
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,839
Instinct, Mastro, instinct.

139
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:37,839
Only the Magyar races can produce that air of the divine right.

140
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,839
Those resolute eyes.

141
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,839
She is a princess.

142
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,839
What do you say, Professor?

143
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:50,839
I say, an ordinary London girl out of the gutter and taught to speak by an expert.

144
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,839
I place her in Drury Lane.

145
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,839
Oh, Mastro, Mastro.

146
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,480
You are mad on the subject of Cockney dialects.

147
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,480
The London gutter is the whole world for you.

148
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,480
What does Your Excellency say?

149
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Oh, of course I agree with Neptune.

150
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,480
She must be a princess at least.

151
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Not necessarily legitimate, of course, but that is undoubtedly her class.

152
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
I stick to my opinion.

153
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,480
You are incorrigible.

154
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Where is Eliza?

155
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
You must keep an eye on her.

156
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,480
I don't think I can bear much more.

157
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
The people all stare so at me.

158
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,480
An old lady has just told me that I speak exactly like Queen Victoria.

159
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,480
I am sorry if I have lost your bet.

160
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,480
I have done my best, but nothing can make me the same as these people.

161
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
You have not lost it, my dear.

162
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,480
You have won it ten times over.

163
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
I've had enough of chattering to these fools.

164
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,119
Eliza is tired and I am hungry.

165
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:58,119
Let us clear out and have supper somewhere.

166
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,119
I say, pick lock up, will you?

167
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,119
Right.

168
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Can Mrs Pearce go to bed?

169
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
We don't want anything more, do we?

170
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Oh, no.

171
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
I say, Mrs Pearce will row if we leave our coats lying about in the drawing room.

172
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Chuck them over the banisters into the hall.

173
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,760
She'll find them there in the morning and put them away all right.

174
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
She'll think we were drunk.

175
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,760
We are, most likely.

176
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Are there any letters?

177
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
I didn't look.

178
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,400
I wonder where the devil my slippers are?

179
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Only circulars and this coroneted billet do for you.

180
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Oh, yeah, money lender.

181
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Oh, Lord, what an evening.

182
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
What a crew.

183
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,039
Silly tomfoolery.

184
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,039
Oh, here are my slippers.

185
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,039
Look.

186
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,039
Oh, I feel a bit tired.

187
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,039
It's been a long day.

188
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,039
The garden party, dinner party and the opera.

189
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,039
Not too much of a good thing.

190
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,039
But you've won your bet, Higgins.

191
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:38,039
Eliza did the trick and something to spare.

192
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,039
Thank God it's over.

193
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,039
Were you nervous at the garden party?

194
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,039
I was.

195
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:46,039
Eliza didn't seem a bit nervous.

196
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,039
No, she wasn't nervous.

197
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,679
I've had a routine of putting the job through

198
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,679
all these months that has told on me.

199
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,679
It was interesting enough at first

200
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,679
while we were at the phonetics.

201
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,679
But after that, I got deadly sick of it.

202
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,679
If I hadn't backed myself to do it,

203
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,679
I should have chucked the whole thing up two months ago.

204
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,679
It was a silly notion.

205
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,679
The whole thing had been a bore.

206
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,679
Oh, come.

207
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,679
The garden party was frightfully exciting.

208
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,679
My heart began beating like anything.

209
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,679
Well, yes, for the first three minutes.

210
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,679
But when I saw we were going to win hands down,

211
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
sitting in a cage, hanging about, doing nothing,

212
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
the dinner was worse.

213
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Sitting gorging there for over an hour

214
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
with nobody but a damn fool

215
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
of a fashionable woman to talk to.

216
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I tell you, Pickering,

217
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
never again for me.

218
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
No more artificial duchesses.

219
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
The whole thing has been simple perpetrate.

220
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Well, you've never been broken in properly

221
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
to the social routine.

222
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
I rather enjoy dipping into it occasionally myself.

223
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Makes me feel young again.

224
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Anyhow, it was a great success,

225
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
an immense success.

226
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
I was quite frightened once or twice

227
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
because Eliza was doing it so well.

228
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
You see, lots of the real people can't do it at all.

229
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
They're such fools that they think

230
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
style comes by nature to people in their position,

231
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
and so they never learn.

232
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
There's always something professional

233
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
about doing a thing superlatively well.

234
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Yes.

235
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
That's what drives me mad.

236
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Silly people don't know their own silly business.

237
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
However,

238
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
it's over and done with,

239
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,599
and I can go to bed at last without dreading tomorrow.

240
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,599
Yes, I think I shall turn in too.

241
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:20,599
Still, it's been a great occasion,

242
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:22,599
a triumph for you.

243
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,599
Good night.

244
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:26,599
Good night.

245
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,599
Oh, put out the lights.

246
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,599
And tell Mrs. Pierce

247
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:32,599
not to make coffee for me in the morning.

248
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,599
I'll take D.

249
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,599
What the devil have I done with my slippers?

250
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,599
There are your slippers.

251
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,599
And there.

252
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,599
Take your slippers and make you never have a day's luck with them.

253
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:52,599
What on earth?

254
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,599
What's the matter?

255
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,599
Anything wrong?

256
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,599
Nothing wrong with you.

257
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,599
I've won your bet for you, haven't I?

258
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,599
That's enough for you.

259
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,599
I don't matter, I suppose.

260
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,599
You won my bet?

261
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,599
You presumptuous insect.

262
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,599
I won it.

263
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,599
What did you throw those slippers at me for?

264
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:15,239
I wanted to smash your face.

265
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:17,239
I'd like to kill you, you selfish brute.

266
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,239
Why didn't you leave me where you picked me out of,

267
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,239
in the gutter?

268
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,239
You thank God it's all over,

269
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,239
and that now you can throw me back again there, do you?

270
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:27,239
The creature is nervous after all.

271
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,239
Get up.

272
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:31,239
Would you?

273
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:33,239
Crawl in, you cat.

274
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,239
How dare you show your temper to me?

275
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,239
Sit down and be quiet.

276
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:45,239
What's to become of me?

277
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,239
What's to become of me?

278
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:49,239
How the devil do I know what's to become of you?

279
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:51,239
What does it matter what becomes of you?

280
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:53,239
You don't care.

281
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,239
I know you don't care.

282
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:57,239
You wouldn't care if I was dead.

283
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,239
I am nothing to you.

284
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:01,239
Not so much as them slippers.

285
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,239
Those slippers!

286
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,239
Those slippers.

287
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:07,239
I didn't think it made any difference now.

288
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Why have you begun

289
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
going on like this?

290
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
May I ask

291
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
whether you complain of your treatment here?

292
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
No.

293
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Has anybody behaved badly to you?

294
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Colonel Pickering?

295
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Mrs. Pierce?

296
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
Any of the servants?

297
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,880
No.

298
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
I presume you don't pretend that I have treated you badly?

299
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
No.

300
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
I am glad to hear it.

301
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Perhaps you're tired after the strain of the day.

302
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Will you have a glass of champagne?

303
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
No!

304
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
Thank you.

305
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
This has been coming on you

306
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
for some days.

307
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
I suppose it was natural

308
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
for you to be anxious

309
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
about the garden party

310
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
but that's all over now.

311
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
There's nothing more to worry about.

312
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
No.

313
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Nothing more for you to worry about.

314
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Oh God,

315
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
I wish I was dead!

316
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,159
Why?

317
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,159
In heaven's name, why?

318
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,159
Listen to me, Eliza.

319
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,159
All this irritation is purely subjective.

320
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,159
I don't understand!

321
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,159
I'm too ignorant!

322
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,159
It's only imagination.

323
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,159
Low spirits

324
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,159
and nothing else.

325
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,159
Nobody's hurting you.

326
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,159
Nothing's wrong.

327
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,159
You go to bed like a good girl

328
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,159
and sleep it off.

329
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,799
That will make you comfortable.

330
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,799
I heard your prayers.

331
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,799
Thank God it's all over!

332
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,799
Don't you thank God it's all over?

333
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,799
Now you are free

334
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,799
and can do what you like.

335
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,799
What am I fit for?

336
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,799
What have you left me fit for?

337
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,799
Where am I to go?

338
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,799
What am I to do?

339
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,799
What's to become of me?

340
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,799
That's what's worrying you, eh?

341
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,799
I shouldn't bother about it

342
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
if I were you.

343
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I should imagine you won't have much difficulty

344
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
in settling yourself somewhere.

345
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
I hadn't quite realised

346
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
that you were going away.

347
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
You might marry.

348
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
You see,

349
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
all men are not confirmed old bachelors

350
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
like me and the Colonel.

351
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Most men are the marrying sort.

352
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
Poor devils.

353
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
And you're not bad looking.

354
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
It's a pleasure to look at you sometimes.

355
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Not now, of course,

356
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,080
because you're crying and looking as ugly

357
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,080
as a very devil.

358
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,080
But when you're alright

359
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,080
and yourself,

360
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,080
you're what I should call

361
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,080
attractive,

362
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
that is to the people

363
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,080
in the marrying line,

364
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,080
you go to bed,

365
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
have a nice good rest

366
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
and then get up

367
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
and look at yourself in the glass

368
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,719
and say,

369
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,719
I'm not a bad chap or other

370
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,719
who would do very well.

371
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:07,719
We're above that at the corner

372
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,719
of Tottenham Court Road.

373
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,719
What do you mean?

374
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,719
I sold flowers.

375
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,719
I didn't sell myself.

376
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,719
Now you've made a lady of me,

377
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,719
I'm not fit to sell anything else.

378
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,719
I wish you'd left me where you found me.

379
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,719
Tosh, Eliza!

380
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,719
Don't you insult human relations

381
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,719
by dragging all this cant about

382
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:30,359
What about your old idea

383
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:32,359
of a florist shop?

384
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,359
Pickering could set you up in one.

385
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,359
He's lots of money.

386
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:38,359
He'll have to pay for all those togs you've been wearing today.

387
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:40,359
And that, with the hire of the jewellery,

388
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,359
will make a big hole in £200.

389
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,359
Why?

390
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:46,359
Six months ago,

391
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:48,359
you would have thought it the millennium

392
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:50,359
to have a flower shop of your own.

393
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,359
Come,

394
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,359
you'll be alright.

395
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,359
I must clear off to bed.

396
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm terribly sleepy.

397
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
By the way, I came down for something.

398
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I forget what it was.

399
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Your slippers.

400
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, yes, of course.

401
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You shied them at me.

402
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Before you go, sir.

403
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Huh?

404
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Do my clothes

405
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
belong to me or to Colonel Pickering?

406
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What the devil

407
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
use would they be to Pickering?

408
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He might want them for the next girl

409
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
you pick up to experiment on.

410
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,640
Is that the way you feel towards us?

411
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
I don't want to hear anything more about it.

412
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,640
All I want to know

413
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
is whether anything belongs to me.

414
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,640
My own clothes were burnt.

415
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,640
But what does it matter?

416
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Why need you start bothering about that

417
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,640
in the middle of the night?

418
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
I want to know

419
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
what I may take away with me.

420
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
I don't want to be accused of stealing.

421
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
Stealing?

422
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Oh, no,

423
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
you shouldn't have said that, Eliza.

424
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
That shows a want of feeling.

425
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
I'm sorry.

426
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I'm only a common, ignorant girl.

427
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
And in my station, I have to be careful.

428
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
There can't be any feelings

429
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
between the like of you and the like of me.

430
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Please will you tell me

431
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
what belongs to me and what doesn't?

432
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Oh, you may take the whole damned house full

433
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
if you like.

434
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Except the jewels. They're hired.

435
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Will that satisfy you?

436
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Stop, please.

437
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Will you take these to your room

438
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
and keep them safe?

439
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
I don't want to run the risk of their being missing.

440
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Hand them over!

441
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,920
If these belonged to me

442
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
instead of to the jeweler,

443
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
I'd ram them down your ungrateful throat.

444
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,920
This ring isn't the jeweler's.

445
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

446
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
I don't want it now.

447
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Oh, you infamous creature.

448
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Don't you hit me!

449
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Hit you?

450
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
How dare you accuse me of such a thing?

451
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
You've hit me.

452
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
You have wounded me to the heart.

453
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,560
I'm glad.

454
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,560
I've got a little of my own back, anyhow.

455
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,560
You have caused me

456
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,560
to lose my temper.

457
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
A thing that has hardly ever

458
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
happened to me before.

459
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,560
I prefer to say nothing more tonight.

460
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
I am going to bed.

461
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,560
We had better leave a note

462
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
for Mrs. Pierce about the coffee.

463
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,560
For she won't be told

464
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
by me.

465
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:22,199
Damn Mrs. Pierce

466
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:24,199
and damn the coffee

467
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,199
and damn you

468
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,199
and damn my own folly

469
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,199
for having lavished

470
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:32,199
my hard-earned knowledge

471
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,199
and the treasure

472
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:36,199
of my regard

473
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:38,199
and intimacy

474
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,199
on a heartless guttersnipe.

475
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,199
Mmm.

476
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:54,199
Mmm.

477
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:56,199
Mmm.

478
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:58,199
Mmm.

479
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:00,199
Mmm.

480
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,199
Mmm.

481
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:04,199
Mmm.

482
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:06,199
Freddy!

483
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:08,199
What are you doing here?

484
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,199
Nothing.

485
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:12,199
I spend most of my nights here

486
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:14,199
gazing up at your window.

487
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:16,199
It's the only place where I'm happy.

488
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,199
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

489
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,839
Do you hear?

490
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,839
Lies is good enough for me.

491
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,839
Freddy.

492
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,839
You don't think I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

493
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,839
Oh, no.

494
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,839
Darling, how can you imagine such a thing?

495
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,839
You...

496
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,839
You are the loveliest, dearest...

497
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,839
Oh!

498
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,839
Mmm.

499
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,839
Oh!

500
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,839
Marvin! Marvin!

501
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,839
Sorry, Constable.

502
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,839
We've only just become engaged.

503
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,479
Double quick.

504
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:56,479
You didn't half give me a fight, that copper.

505
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:58,479
But you answered him proper.

506
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,479
I had no idea the police were so devilishly prudish.

507
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,479
It's their business

508
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,479
to hunt girls off the streets.

509
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,479
I hope I haven't taken you out of your way.

510
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,479
Where were you going?

511
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,479
To the river.

512
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,479
What for?

513
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,479
To make a hole in it.

514
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,479
Eliza, darling, what do you mean?

515
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,119
I don't know.

516
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,119
There's nobody in the world now,

517
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,119
but you and me is there.

518
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,119
Not a soul.

519
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,119
Look, we must go somewhere.

520
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,119
We can't wander about the streets all night.

521
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,119
Can't we?

522
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,119
I think it'd be lovely to wander about forever.

523
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,119
Oh, darling.

524
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Can I drive you and the lady

525
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
anywhere, sir?

526
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Oh, Freddy, a taxi.

527
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
The very thing.

528
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
But dammit, I've no money.

529
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
I have plenty.

530
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
The Colonel thinks you should never go out

531
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
without ten pounds in your pocket.

532
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Listen, we'll drive about all night,

533
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
and in the morning, I'll call old Mrs. Higgins

534
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
and ask her what I ought to do.

535
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
I'll tell you all about it in the cab.

536
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Right-o. A ripping.

537
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Wimbledon Common.

538
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
MUSIC

539
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Mr. Henry, ma'am, is downstairs

540
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
with Colonel Pickering.

541
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Well, show them up.

542
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
They're using the telephone, ma'am.

543
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
Telephoning to the police, I think.

544
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
What?

545
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
Mr. Henry's in a state, ma'am.

546
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
If you'd told me that Mr. Henry was not in a state,

547
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
it would have been more surprising.

548
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Tell them to come up when they've finished

549
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
with the police.

550
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
I suppose he's lost something.

551
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Yes, ma'am.

552
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Go upstairs and tell Miss Doolittle

553
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
that Mr. Henry and the Colonel are here.

554
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Ask her not to come down

555
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
till I send for her.

556
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Yes, ma'am.

557
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Look, young mother,

558
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
here's a confounded thing.

559
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Yes, dear.

560
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
What is it?

561
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,040
Eliza's bolted.

562
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
You must have frightened her.

563
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Frightened her? Nonsense.

564
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
She was left last night as usual

565
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,040
to turn out the lights and all that

566
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
and instead of going to bed

567
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
she changed her clothes and went right off.

568
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Her bed wasn't slept in.

569
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
She came in a cab for her things

570
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
before seven this morning

571
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
and that fool Mrs. Pearce let her have them

572
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
without telling me a word about it.

573
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
What am I to do?

574
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
With all the appointments I've got

575
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
I'm absolutely lost, Mrs. Higgins.

576
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,680
Has Henry told you?

577
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,680
What does that ass of an inspector say?

578
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,680
Have you offered a reward?

579
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,680
You don't need to say that you set the police

580
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,680
after Eliza.

581
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Of course. What are the police for?

582
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
What else could we do?

583
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
The inspector made a lot of difficulties.

584
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
I really think he suspected us

585
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,680
of some improper purpose.

586
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Of course he did.

587
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
What right have you to go to the police

588
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,319
But we want to find her.

589
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,319
We can't let her go like this, you know, Mrs. Higgins.

590
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,319
What are we to do?

591
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,319
You have no more sense, either of you,

592
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,319
than two children.

593
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,319
Mr. Henry, a gentleman wants to see you

594
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,319
very particular.

595
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:20,319
He's been sent on from Wimpole Street.

596
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,319
I can't see anyone now. Who is it?

597
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,319
Mr. Doolittle, sir.

598
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,319
Doolittle? Do you mean the dustman?

599
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:28,319
Dustman? No, sir. A gentleman.

600
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,319
By George Pick!

601
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,319
It's some relative of hers that she's gone to.

602
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:34,959
A relative we know nothing about.

603
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,959
Send him up, quick!

604
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,959
Yes, sir.

605
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,959
Gentile relatives?

606
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,959
Now we shall hear some things.

607
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,959
Do you know any of her people?

608
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,959
Only her father, the fellow we told you about.

609
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,959
Mr. Doolittle.

610
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,959
See here? Do you see this?

611
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,959
You done this?

612
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,959
Done what, man?

613
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,959
This, I tell you. Look at it.

614
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,959
Look at this silk hat. Look at this frock coat.

615
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,959
These shoes.

616
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,599
Why would she buy me clothes?

617
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,599
Good morning, Mr. Doolittle.

618
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,599
Won't you sit down?

619
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,599
Asking your pardon, ma'am.

620
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,599
Thank you.

621
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,599
I'm that full of what has happened to me

622
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,599
that I can't think of anything else.

623
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,599
What the dickens has happened to you?

624
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,599
I shouldn't mind if it had only happened to me.

625
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,599
Anything might happen to anybody

626
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,599
and nobody to blame but Providence, as you might say.

627
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,599
But this is something you

628
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,599
have done to me.

629
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,599
Yes, you, Henry Higgins.

630
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:32,239
You found Eliza.

631
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,239
Have you lost her?

632
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:36,239
Yes.

633
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:38,239
You have all the luck you have.

634
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:40,239
I ain't found her but she'll find me

635
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,239
quick enough now after what you have done to me.

636
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:44,239
But what has my son done to you, Mr. Doolittle?

637
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:46,239
Done to me? Ruined me.

638
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:48,239
Destroyed my happiness.

639
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:50,239
Tied me up and delivered me

640
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,239
into the hands of middle class morality.

641
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:54,239
You're raving.

642
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:56,239
You're drunk.

643
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:58,239
You're mad.

644
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
Drunk, am I?

645
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Murder, am I?

646
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Tell me this.

647
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Did you or did you not

648
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
write a letter to an old blighter in America

649
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
that was giving five millions

650
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
to found moral reform societies

651
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
all over the world and that wanted you

652
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
to invent a universal language for him?

653
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
What? Ezra D. Wannafella?

654
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
He's dead.

655
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
Yes, he's dead.

656
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,880
And I'm done for.

657
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
Now, did you or did you not

658
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,520
expect to him to say that the most original moralist

659
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
at present in England, to the best of your knowledge,

660
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
was Alfred Doolittle,

661
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
a common dustman?

662
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
Oh. Well, after your last visit,

663
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
I remember making some silly joke of the kind.

664
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
Oh.

665
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
You may well call it

666
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
a silly joke.

667
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
It put the lid on me right enough.

668
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Just give him the chance he wanted

669
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
to show that Americans is not like us.

670
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
That they recognize and respect merit

671
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
in every class of life, however humble.

672
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
Them words is in his blooming will

673
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
in which, Henry Higgins,

674
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
thanks to your silly joking,

675
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
he leaves me a share in his pre-digested

676
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
cheese trust worth 3,000 a year

677
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
on condition that I lecture

678
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
for his Wannafella Moral Reform World League

679
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
as often as they ask me.

680
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Up to six times a year.

681
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
That definitely does. Oh, what a lark.

682
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
A safe thing for you, Doolittle.

683
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
They won't ask you twice.

684
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
It ain't the lecture in my mind.

685
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
I'll lecture them blue in the face I will

686
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
and not turn an ear.

687
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
It's making a gentleman of me that I object to.

688
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Who asked him to make a gentleman of me?

689
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
I was happy.

690
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
I was free.

691
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
I touched pretty nigh everybody

692
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
for money when I wanted it.

693
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Same as I touched you, Henry Higgins.

694
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Now I am worried

695
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
tied neck and heels

696
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
and everybody touches me for money.

697
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
When I was a poor man

698
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
the doctors used to shove me out of the hospital

699
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
before I could hardly stand on my legs

700
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,439
and I had nothing to pay.

701
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,439
Now they find out that I'm not a healthy man

702
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:59,439
and can't live unless they looks after me twice a day.

703
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,439
In the house, I'm not let to do

704
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:03,439
an hand's turn for meself.

705
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,439
Somebody else must do it

706
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,439
and touch me for it.

707
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:09,439
A year ago, I hadn't a relative in the world

708
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,439
except two or three that wouldn't speak to me.

709
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,439
Now I have 50

710
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:15,439
and not a decent week's wages among a lot of them.

711
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:17,439
I have to live for others

712
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:19,439
and not for meself.

713
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,439
That's middle class morality.

714
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,079
Don't you be anxious.

715
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,079
I bet she's on my doorstep by this.

716
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,079
She that could support herself easy

717
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,079
by selling flowers if I wasn't respectable.

718
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,079
And the next one to touch me

719
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,079
will be you.

720
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,079
Henry Higgins, I'll have to learn

721
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:38,079
to speak middle class language from you

722
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,079
instead of speaking proper English.

723
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,079
That's where you'll come in

724
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,079
and I dare say

725
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,079
that's what you've done it for.

726
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,079
But my dear Mr Doolittle

727
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:50,079
you need not suffer all this

728
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:52,719
if you're really in earnest.

729
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,719
Nobody can force you to accept this bequest.

730
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,719
You can repudiate it.

731
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:58,719
Isn't that so, Colonel Pickering?

732
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,719
I believe so.

733
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:02,719
That's the tragedy of it, ma'am.

734
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:04,719
It's easy to say chuck it

735
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,719
but I haven't the nerve.

736
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:08,719
Which one of us has?

737
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:10,719
We're all intimidated.

738
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,719
Intimidated, ma'am.

739
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,719
That's what we are.

740
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,719
What is there for me if I chuck it

741
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:18,719
but the workhouse in my old age?

742
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,359
If I was one of the deserving poor

743
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,359
and had put by a bit

744
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:25,359
I could chuck it

745
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,359
but then why should I?

746
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,359
Because the deserving poor might as well be millionaires

747
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:31,359
for all the happiness they ever have.

748
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,359
They don't know what happiness is.

749
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,359
But I, as one of the undeserving poor

750
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,359
have nothing between me and a pauper's uniform

751
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,359
but this here blasted

752
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,359
three thousand a year

753
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,359
that shoves me into the middle class.

754
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,359
Excuse the expression, ma'am.

755
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,359
You'd use it yourself if you had my provocation.

756
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
They've got you every way you turn.

757
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Intimidated.

758
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That's what I am.

759
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Broke. Bought up.

760
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Happier men than me will call for my dust

761
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and touch me for their tip.



1
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And I'll look on, helpless, and envied of them, and that, that's what your son has brought me to.

2
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Well, I'm very glad you're not going to do anything foolish, Mr Doolittle.

3
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
But this solves the problem of Eliza's future. You can provide for her now.

4
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes, Mum. I'm expected to provide for everyone now, out of 3,000 a year.

5
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Nonsense. He can't provide for her. He shan't provide for her. She doesn't belong to him.

6
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I paid him five pounds for her. Doolittle, either you're an honest man or a rogue.

7
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
A little of both, Henry, like the rest of us. A little of both.

8
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But you took that money for the girl, and you've no rights to take her as well.

9
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Henry, don't be absurd. If you really want to know where Eliza is, she's upstairs.

10
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Upstairs? Well, then I shall jolly soon fetch her downstairs.

11
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Be quiet, Henry. Sit down.

12
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I?

13
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Sit down, dear, and listen to me.

14
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Oh, very well, very well, very well. But I think you might have told us this half an hour ago.

15
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Eliza came to me this morning. She told me of the brutal way you two treated her.

16
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
What?

17
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
My dear Mrs Higgins, she's been telling you stories. We didn't treat her brutally.

18
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Brutally? We hardly said a word to her, and we parted on particularly good terms.

19
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Higgins, did you bully her after I went to bed?

20
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Just the other way about. She threw my slippers in my face.

21
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
She behaved in the most outrageous way. I never gave her the slightest provocation.

22
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
The slippers came bang into my face the moment I entered the room,

23
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
before I had uttered a word and used perfectly awful language.

24
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But why? What did we do to her?

25
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I think I know pretty well what you did.

26
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The girl is naturally rather affectionate, I think. Isn't she, Mr Doolittle?

27
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Very tender-hearted, ma'am. Takes after me.

28
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Just so. She had become attached to you both.

29
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
She worked very hard for you, Henry.

30
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I don't think you quite realise what anything in the nature of brain work means to a girl like that.

31
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Well, it seems to me that when the great day of trial came,

32
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and she did this wonderful thing for you without making a single mistake,

33
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
you two sat there and never said a word to her,

34
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
but talked together of how glad you were that it was all over,

35
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and how you'd been bored with the whole thing.

36
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And then you were surprised because she threw your slippers at you.

37
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I should have thrown the fire irons at you.

38
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
We said nothing except that we were tired and wanted to go to bed. Did we, Peg?

39
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
That was all.

40
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Quite sure?

41
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Absolutely. Really, that was all.

42
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You didn't thank her, or pet her, or admire her, or tell her how splendid she'd been.

43
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But she knew all about that. We didn't make speeches to her, if that's what you mean.

44
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Perhaps we were a little inconsiderate.

45
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Is she very angry?

46
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm afraid she won't go back to Wimpole Street,

47
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
especially now that Mr Doolittle is able to keep up the position that you thrust upon her.

48
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But she says she's quite willing to meet you on friendly terms and let bygones be bygones.

49
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Is she, bright George?

50
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
If you promise to behave yourself, Henry, I'll ask her to come down.

51
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
If not, go home, for you've taken up quite enough of my time.

52
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
All right. Very well.

53
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Peg, you behave yourself.

54
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Let us put on our best Sunday manners for this creature that we picked out of the mud.

55
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Now, now, Henry Higgins. Have some consideration for my feelings as a middle-class man.

56
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Remember your promise, Henry.

57
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Mr Doolittle, will you be good enough as to step out on the balcony for a moment?

58
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I don't want Eliza to have the shock of your news until she's made it up with these two gentlemen.

59
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Would you mind?

60
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
As you wish, lady. Anything to help Henry keep her off my hands.

61
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Ask Miss Doolittle to come down, please.

62
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yes, ma'am.

63
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Now, Henry, be good.

64
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I am behaving myself perfectly.

65
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
He is doing his best, Mrs Higgins.

66
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Henry, dearest, you don't look at all nice in that attitude.

67
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I was not trying to look nice, Mother.

68
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It doesn't matter, dear. I only wanted to make you speak.

69
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Why?

70
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Because you can't speak and whistle at the same time.

71
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh, the devil is that girl.

72
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Are we to wait here all day?

73
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
How do you do, Professor Higgins?

74
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Are you comfortable?

75
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
How do you do, Professor Higgins?

76
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Are you quite well?

77
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Am I?

78
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But of course you are. You are never ill.

79
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So glad to see you again, Colonel Pickering.

80
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Quite chilly this morning, isn't it?

81
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Don't you dare try this game on me.

82
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I taught it to you and it doesn't take me in.

83
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Get up and come home and don't be a fool.

84
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.

85
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
No woman could resist such an invitation.

86
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Do let her alone, Mother. Let her speak for herself.

87
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You will jolly soon see whether she has an idea that I haven't put into her head

88
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
or a word that I haven't put into her mouth.

89
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I tell you, I have created this thing

90
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent Garden

91
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
and now she pretends to play the fine lady with me.

92
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yes, dear, but you'll sit down, won't you?

93
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Will you drop me altogether now that the experiment is over, Colonel Pickering?

94
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh, don't. You mustn't think of it as an experiment.

95
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It shocks me somehow.

96
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Oh, I'm only a squashed cabbage leaf.

97
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
No.

98
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But I owe so much to you that I should be very unhappy if you forgot me.

99
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's very kind of you to say so, Miss Doolittle.

100
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's not because you paid for my dresses.

101
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I know you are generous to everybody with money

102
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
but it was from you that I learnt really nice manners

103
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and that is what makes one a lady, isn't it?

104
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You see, it was so very difficult for me

105
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
with the example of Professor Higgins always before me.

106
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I was brought up to be just like him.

107
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Unable to control myself

108
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and using bad language on the slightest provocation.

109
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And I should never have known that ladies and gentlemen

110
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
didn't behave like that if you hadn't been there.

111
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
He taught you to speak and I couldn't have done that, you know.

112
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Of course, that is his profession.

113
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Damnation, Henry!

114
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It was just like learning to dance in the fashionable way.

115
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
There is nothing more than that in it.

116
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But do you know what began my real education?

117
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
What?

118
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Your calling me Miss Doolittle that day when I first came to Wimpole Street.

119
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
That was the beginning of self-respect for me.

120
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And there were a hundred little things you never noticed

121
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
because they came naturally to you.

122
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Things about standing up and taking off your hat and opening doors.

123
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Oh, that was nothing.

124
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Yes, things that showed you thought and felt about me

125
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
as if I was something better than a scullery maid.

126
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Though, of course, I know you would have been just the same to a scullery maid

127
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
if she had been let in the drawing room.

128
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You never took off your boots in the dining room when I was there.

129
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Oh, you mustn't mind that.

130
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Higgins takes off his boots all over the place.

131
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I know. I'm not blaming him.

132
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It is his way, isn't it?

133
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But it made such a difference to me that you didn't do it.

134
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You see, really and truly, apart from the things anyone could pick up

135
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
the dressing and the proper way of speaking and so on

136
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
the difference between a lady and a flower girl

137
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
is not how she behaves but how she is treated.

138
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I shall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins

139
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will.

140
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But I know I can be a lady to you

141
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
because you always treat me as a lady and always will.

142
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Please don't grind your teeth, Henry.

143
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Well, this is really very nice of you, Miss Doolittle.

144
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I should like you to call me Eliza now, if you would.

145
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Oh, thank you. Eliza, of course.

146
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And I should like Professor Higgins to call me Miss Doolittle.

147
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'll see you damned first!

148
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Henry, Henry.

149
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Why don't you slang back at him?

150
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Don't stand it. It would do him a lot of good.

151
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I can't. I could have done it once.

152
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
But now I can't go back to it.

153
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Last night, when I was wandering about, a girl spoke to me

154
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and I tried to get back into the old way with her, but it was no use.

155
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You told me, you know, that when a child is brought to a foreign country

156
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
it picks up the language in a few weeks and forgets its own.

157
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Well, I am a child in your country.

158
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I have forgotten my own language and can speak nothing but yours.

159
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
That's the real break-off with the corner of Tottenham Court Road.

160
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Leaving Wimpole Street finishes it.

161
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh, but you're coming back to Wimpole Street, aren't you?

162
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You'll forgive Higgins?

163
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Forgive? Will she bite George?

164
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Let her go. Let her find out how she can get on without us.

165
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
She will relapse into the gutter in three weeks without me at her elbow.

166
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
He's incorrigible, Eliza.

167
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You won't relapse, will you?

168
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
No, not now. Never again.

169
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I have learnt my lesson.

170
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I don't believe I could utter one of those old sounds if I tried.

171
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Do you at all? What do you say to that?

172
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Do a little?

173
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Oh!

174
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Ha! Just so!

175
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
How! How!

176
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Victory! Victory!

177
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Can you blame the girl?

178
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Don't look at me like that, Eliza.

179
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It ain't my fault. I've come into money.

180
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You must have touched a millionaire this time, Dad.

181
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I have, but I'm dressed something special today.

182
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm going to St George's, Hanover Square.

183
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Your stepmother is going to marry me!

184
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You're going to let yourself down to marry that low, common woman?

185
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
He ought to, Eliza. Why has she changed her mind?

186
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Intimidated, Governor. Intimidated!

187
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Middle-class morality claims its victim.

188
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Won't you put on your hat, Eliza, and come and see me turned off?

189
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
If the Colonel says I must, I...

190
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'll... I'll demean myself

191
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and get insulted for my pains, like enough.

192
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Don't be afraid. She never comes to words with anyone now, poor woman.

193
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Respectability has broken all the spirit out of her.

194
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Be kind to them, Eliza. Make the best of it.

195
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Oh, well, just to show there's no ill feeling.

196
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I'll be back in a moment.

197
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I feel uncommon nervous about the ceremony, Colonel.

198
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I wish you'd come and see me through it.

199
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
But you've been through it before, Matt.

200
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You were married to Eliza's mother.

201
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Who told you that, Colonel?

202
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Well...

203
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Nobody told me, but I concluded that...

204
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
No, no, no, that ain't the natural way, Colonel.

205
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's only the middle-class way.

206
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
My way was always the undeserving way.

207
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
But don't say nothing to Eliza. She don't know.

208
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I always had a delicacy about telling her.

209
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Quite right. We'll leave it so, if you don't mind.

210
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And you'll come at the church, Colonel, and put me through straight?

211
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
With pleasure, as far as a bachelor can.

212
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
May I come, Mr Doolittle?

213
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I should be very sorry to miss your wedding.

214
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Oh, I should indeed be honoured by your condescension, ma'am.

215
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And my poor old woman would take it as a tremendous compliment.

216
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
She's been very low, thinking of the happy days that are no more.

217
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'll order the carriage and get ready.

218
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I shan't be more than 15 minutes.

219
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh, Eliza, I'm going to the church to see your father married.

220
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You had better come in the room with me.

221
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Colonel Pickering can go on with the bridegroom.

222
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Bridegroom?

223
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Oh, what a word!

224
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Makes a man realise his position somehow.

225
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Before I go, Eliza, do forgive Higgins and come back to us.

226
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I don't think Dad would allow me. Would you, Dad?

227
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
They played you off. Very cunning, Eliza.

228
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Them two sportsmen.

229
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
If it had been only one of them, you could have nailed him.

230
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But you see, there was two, and one of them chaperoned the other, as you might say.

231
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It was artful of you, Colonel, but I bear you no malice.

232
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I should have done the same myself.

233
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I've been the victim of one woman after another all my life.

234
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But don't grudge you two getting the better of Eliza.

235
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I shan't interfere.

236
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Right, it's time for us to go, Colonel.

237
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So long, Henry.

238
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
See you in St George's, Eliza.

239
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Do stay with us, Eliza.

240
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Well, Eliza, you've had a bit of your own back, as you call it.

241
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Have you had enough, and are you going to be reasonable,

242
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
or do you want any more?

243
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You want me back only to pick up your slippers and put up with your tempers

244
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and fetch and carry for you.

245
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I haven't said I wanted you back at all.

246
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
No, indeed.

247
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Then what are we talking about?

248
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
About you, not about me.

249
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
If you come back, I shall treat you just as I have always treated you.

250
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I can't change my nature, and I don't intend to change my manners.

251
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
My manners are exactly the same as Colonel Pickering's.

252
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
That's not true. He treats a flower girl as if she was a duchess.

253
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And I treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl.

254
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I see. The same for everybody.

255
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Just so.

256
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Like father?

257
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Without accepting the comparison at all points, Eliza,

258
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
it is quite true that your father is not a snob,

259
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and that he will be quite at home in any station of life

260
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
to which his eccentric destiny may call him.

261
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The great secret, Eliza, is not having bad manners or good manners

262
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
or any other particular sort of manners,

263
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
but having the same manner for all human souls.

264
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
In short, behaving as if you were in heaven,

265
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
where there are no third-class carriages,

266
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and one soul is as good as another.

267
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Amen. You are a born preacher.

268
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The question is not whether I treat you rudely,

269
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
but whether you ever heard me treat anyone else better.

270
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I don't care how you treat me.

271
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I don't mind you swearing at me.

272
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I don't mind a black eye.

273
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I've had one before this, but I won't be passed over.

274
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You talk about me as if I were a motor bus.

275
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So you are a motor bus, all bounce and go,

276
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
and no consideration for anyone.

277
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But I can do without you. Don't think I can't.

278
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I know you can. I told you, you could.

279
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Oh!

280
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
You never asked yourself, I suppose,

281
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
whether I could do without you.

282
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Don't you try to get around me.

283
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You'll have to do without me.

284
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Oh, I can do without anybody.

285
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I have my own soul, my own spark of divine fire.

286
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
But I shall miss you, Eliza.

287
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I have learnt something from your idiotic notions.

288
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I confess that, humbly and gratefully.

289
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And I have grown accustomed to your voice and appearance.

290
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I like them, rather.

291
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Well, you have both of them on your gramophone

292
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and in your book of photographs.

293
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
When you feel lonely without me, you can turn the machine on.

294
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It's got no feelings to hurt.

295
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I can't turn your soul on.

296
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Leave me those feelings.

297
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And you can take away the voice and the face.

298
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
They are not you.

299
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh, you are a devil.

300
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You can twist the heart in a girl

301
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
as easy as some could twist her arms to hurt her.

302
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Mrs Pierce warned me.

303
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Time and again she has wanted to leave you.

304
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And you always got round her at the last minute.

305
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And you don't care a bit for her.

306
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And you don't care a bit for me.

307
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I care for life, for humanity.

308
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And you are a part of it that has come my way

309
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and been built into my house.

310
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
What more can you or anyone ask?

311
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I won't care for anybody that doesn't care for me.

312
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Commercial principles, Eliza.

313
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Like silly violets, isn't it?

314
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Don't sneer at me. It's mean to sneer at me.

315
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I have never sneered in my life.

316
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Sneering doesn't become either the human face or the human soul.

317
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I am expressing my righteous contempt for commercialism.

318
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I don't and won't trade in affection.

319
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
You call me a brute because you couldn't buy a claim on me

320
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
by fetching my slippers and finding my spectacles.

321
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
You are a fool.

322
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
To think a woman fetching a man's slippers is a disgusting sight.

323
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Did I ever fetch your slippers?

324
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I think a good deal more of you for throwing them in my face.

325
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
No use slaving for me and then saying you want to be cared for.

326
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Who cares for a slave?

327
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
If you come back, come back for the sake of good fellowship,

328
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
for you'll get nothing else.

329
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You've had a thousand times as much out of me as I have out of you.

330
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And if you dare to set up your little dog's tricks

331
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
by carrying slippers against my creation of a duchess, Eliza,

332
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I'll slam the door in your silly face.

333
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
What did you do it for if you didn't care for me?

334
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Why, because it was my job.

335
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
You never thought of the trouble it would make for me?

336
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Would the world ever have been made

337
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
if its maker had been afraid of making trouble?

338
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Making life means making trouble.

339
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm no preacher. I don't notice things like that.

340
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I notice that you don't notice me.

341
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
No, Eliza, you're an idiot.

342
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I waste the treasures of my Miltonic mind by spreading them before you.

343
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Once for all, understand that I go my way and do my work

344
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
without carrying tuppence what happens to either of us.

345
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I am not intimidated like your father and your stepmother.

346
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So you can come back or go to the devil, which you please.

347
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
What am I to come back for?

348
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.

349
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And you may throw me out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want me to?

350
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yes, and you may walk out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want me to.

351
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And live with my stepmother?

352
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Yes, or sell flowers.

353
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Oh, if I only could go back to my flower basket,

354
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I should be independent of both you and Father and all the world.

355
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Why did you take my independence from me?

356
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Why did I give it up?

357
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I'm a slave now for all my fine clothes.

358
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Not a bit.

359
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I'll adopt you as my daughter and settle money on you, if you like.

360
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Would you rather marry Pickering?

361
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I wouldn't marry you if you asked me.

362
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And you're nearer my age than what he is.

363
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Than he is, not than what he is.

364
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Oh, I'll talk as I like. You're not my teacher now.

365
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I don't suppose Pickering would, though.

366
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
He's as confirmed an old bachelor as I am.

367
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That's not what I want. And don't you think it.

368
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I've always had chaps enough wanting me that way.

369
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Freddy Hill writes to me twice and three times a day.

370
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Sheets and sheets.

371
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Damn his impudence.

372
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
He might do if he likes, poor lad.

373
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And he does love me.

374
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You have no right to encourage him.

375
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Every girl has a right to be loved.

376
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
What? By fools like that?

377
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Freddy's not a fool.

378
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And if he's weak and poor and wants me,

379
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
maybe he'd make me happier than my betters

380
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
that bully me and don't want me.

381
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Can he make anything of you? That's the point.

382
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Perhaps I could make something of him.

383
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But I never thought of us making anything of one another.

384
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I never think of anything else.

385
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I only want to be natural.

386
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
In short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as Freddy.

387
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Is that it? No, I don't.

388
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That's not the sort of feeling I want from you.

389
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And don't you be too sure of yourself or of me.

390
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I could have been a bad girl if I'd liked.

391
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I've seen more of some things than you for all your learning.

392
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Girls like me can drag gentlemen down to make love to them easy enough,

393
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
and they wish each other dead the next minute.

394
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Of course they do.

395
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Then what in thunder are we quarrelling about?

396
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I want a little kindness.

397
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I know I'm a common ignorant girl and you a book-learned gentleman,

398
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
but I'm not dirt under your feet.

399
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
What I'd done... What I did was not for the dresses and the taxis.

400
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I did it because we were pleasant together and I came to care for you.

401
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Not to want you to make love to me

402
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
and not forgetting the difference between us,

403
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
but more friendly-like.

404
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Well, of course.

405
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
That's just how I feel.

406
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And how Pickering feels.

407
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Eliza, you're a fool.

408
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
That's not a proper answer to give me.

409
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
It's all you get until you stop being a common idiot.

410
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
If you're going to be a lady,

411
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
you'll have to give up feeling neglected

412
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
if the men you know don't spend half their time

413
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
snivelling over you and the other half giving you black eyes.

414
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
If you can't stand the coldness of my sort of life

415
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
and the strain of it, go back to the gutter.

416
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Work till you are more a brute than a human being

417
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
and then cuddle and squabble and drink till you fall asleep.

418
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Oh, it's a fine life, the life of the gutter.

419
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It's real, it's warm, it's violent.

420
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
You can feel it through the thickest skin.

421
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
You can taste it and smell it without any training or any work.

422
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Not like science and literature and classical music

423
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and philosophy and art.

424
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Ah...

425
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don't you?

426
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Very well.

427
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Be off with you to the sort of people you like.

428
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Marry some sentimental hog or other with lots of money

429
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
and a thick pair of lips to kiss you with

430
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and a thick pair of boots to kick you with.

431
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
If you can't appreciate what you've got,

432
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
you'd better get what you can appreciate.

433
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Oh, you are a cruel tyrant.

434
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I can't talk to you. You turn everything against me.

435
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I'm always in the wrong.

436
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
But you know very well all the time that you're nothing but a bully.

437
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
You know I can't go back to the gutter, as you call it,

438
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
and that I have no real friends in the world but you and the Colonel.

439
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
You know well I couldn't bear to live with a low common man after you two

440
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
and it's wicked and cruel of you to insult me by pretending I could.

441
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
You think I must go back to Wimpole Street

442
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
because I have nowhere else to go but fathers.

443
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
But don't you be too sure that you have me under your feet

444
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
to be trampled on and talked down.

445
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as I'm able to support him.

446
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Freddy? That young fool?

447
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
That poor devil who couldn't get a job as an errand boy,

448
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
even if he had the guts to try for it?

449
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Do you not understand that I have made you consort for a king?

450
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Freddy loves me. That makes him king enough for me.

451
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I don't want him to work. He wasn't brought up to it as I was.

452
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I'll go and be a teacher.

453
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
What will you teach in heaven's name?

454
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics.

455
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I'll offer myself as an assistant to that hairy-faced Hungarian.

456
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
What? That imposter? That humbug? That toadying ignoramus?

457
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Teach him my methods, my discoveries.

458
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You take one step in his direction and I'll wring your neck.

459
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Do you hear?

460
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Wring away? What do I care?

461
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I knew you'd strike me someday.

462
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Aha! Now I know how to deal with you.

463
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
What a fool I was not to think of it before.

464
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
You can't take away the knowledge you gave me.

465
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
You said I had a finer ear than you,

466
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
and I can be civil and kind to people which has more than you can.

467
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh! Aha! That's done you, Henry Ickensley, yes?

468
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Now I don't care that for your bullying and your big talk.

469
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I'll advertise it in the papers

470
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
that your duchess is only a flower girl that you taught

471
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
and that she'll teach anybody to be a duchess just the same

472
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
in six months for a thousand guineas.

473
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Oh, when I think of myself crawling under your feet

474
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
and being trampled on and called names

475
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
when all the time I had only to lift up my finger

476
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
to be as good as you, I could kick myself.

477
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
You damned impudent slut, you.

478
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
But it's better than snivelling,

479
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
better than fetching slippers and finding spectacles, isn't it?

480
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
By George, Eliza, I said I'd make a woman of you, and I have.

481
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I like you like this.

482
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Yes.

483
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
You can turn round and make up to me now that I'm not afraid of you

484
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and couldn't do without you.

485
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Of course I do, you little fool.

486
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Five minutes ago you were like a millstone round my neck.

487
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Now you're a tower of strength, a consort battleship.

488
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
You and I and Pickering will be three old bachelors together

489
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
instead of only two men and a silly girl.

490
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
The carriage is waiting, Eliza. Are you ready?

491
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Quite. Is the Professor coming?

492
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Certainly not. He can't behave himself in church.

493
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
He makes remarks out loud all the time on the clergyman's pronunciation.

494
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Then I shall not see you again, Professor.

495
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Goodbye.

496
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Goodbye, dear.

497
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Goodbye, Mother.

498
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Oh, by the way, Eliza, order a ham and a Stilton cheese, will you?

499
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And buy me a pair of reindeer gloves, number eights,

500
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and a tie to match that new suit of mine.

501
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
That's Elon Binman's. You can choose the colour.

502
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Number eights are too small for you if you want them lined with lamb's wool.

503
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
You have three new ties that you have forgotten in the drawer of your washstand.

504
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Colonel Pickering prefers double Gloucester to Stilton.

505
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I telephoned Mrs Pierce this morning not to forget the ham.

506
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
What you are to do without me I cannot imagine.

507
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I'm afraid you've spoiled that girl, Henry.

508
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I should be uneasy about you and her if she were less fond of Colonel Pickering.

509
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Pickering? Nonsense!

510
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
She's going to marry Freddie!

511
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

512
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Freddie!

513
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Freddie!

514
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

515
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
In episode two of Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw,

516
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000

517
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Pickering by Hugh Fraser,

518
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
and Eliza by Morgana Robinson.

519
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Doolittle was played by Al Murray,

520
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Nepomuk by David Sturzica,

521
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
and Mrs Higgins by Sian Phillips.

522
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Freddie Eynsford-Hill was played by Tom Forrester,

523
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and a pal made by Charlotte Page.

524
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
The ambassador was John Dougal,

525
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and the ambassador's wife, Sarah Ridgway.

526
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Pygmalion was adopted and directed for radio by Emma Harding.
