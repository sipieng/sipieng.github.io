## EPISODE 1

*Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, dramatised for radio by Jonathan Holloway.*

**AT LENINA'S RESIDENCE**

LENINA
Are you finished in the bathroom, Fanny?

FANNY
Yes, it's all yours.

LENINA
Oh, you look terrific.

FANNY
Of course.

LENINA
I think I'm getting hairier.

FANNY
Use my removal cream.

**MONOLOGUE BY HELMHOLTZ**

> We are in a small flat occupied by two young women, student workers who at the end of a normal day are getting themselves spruced up for the evening ahead. Listen to their happy voices. You would never guess what they do for a living, how they earn their bread, or how they expect to spend their leisure.

FANNY
Tonight would have been my 30th new man.

LENINA
In how long?

FANNY
Six months since January.

LENINA
Very good.

FANNY
Erica Hite did a whole escalator squash team in public last weekend.

LENINA
Gosh, he's such a show-off. What do you mean "would have been"?

FANNY
I may just stay in. I'm not feeling too good.

LENINA
What's the matter?

FANNY
Dr Wells says I should have a three-month pregnancy substitute.

LENINA
You're only 19.

**MONOLOGUE BY HELMHOLTZ**

> Let me introduce myself. My name is Helmholtz Watson. I've decided to write an account of what I now see as an irretrievably corrupted humanity. There might be a very slim chance people will return to a healthier way, and maybe that's why it's worth recording this. That's what I tell myself. I don't hold out much hope, but it is a way of perhaps preserving my own sanity just a little longer. Writing gives a reason not just to curl up with an overdose of the current neurotoxin of choice - Soma.

FANNY
Dr Wells says that women like me with wide pelvises ought to have their first simulated pregnancy when they're 17.

LENINA
I don't usually like wide pelvises. Somehow you carry it off.

FANNY
So anyway, I'm really two years late, not two years early.

LENINA
Are you taking your ovarian?

FANNY
Of course.

LENINA
And your placentin?

FANNY
Of course, Lenina. I'm not a dimwit epsilon.

LENINA
It'll be a pain all weekend if you don't go out and have sex with someone.

FANNY
But if I do have a simulated pregnancy, I shan't be able to have sex for a whole three months.

LENINA
Not nice.

FANNY
Doesn't bear thinking about.

**MONOLOGUE BY HELMHOLTZ**

> All the signs were there, but people didn't want to acknowledge them. Greed bent the post-enlightenment West out of shape. A very few people owned the wealth, and they declared war on the intelligence of the populations of the developed world. America elected an amoral, aggressive gangster to the most powerful job anywhere. He let loose the dogs who turned civilisation into a global cult of numbskull consumerism which would believe any rubbish as long as it justified breakneck consumption of sugar, drugs, and no-strings sex.
> 

FANNY
I assume you're going out?

LENINA
Yes.

FANNY
With who?

LENINA
Henry Foster.

FANNY
Why are you still going out with him?

LENINA
It's only been four months.

FANNY
Four months is a lifetime. Surely you're bored at sex with one man.

LENINA
Well, no, actually. I'm not bored. I find it... comfortable. Comforting.

FANNY
The director would be very upset. He and I did it last week.

LENINA
Oh, yes? How was it?

FANNY
Very dignified. Vigorous, mind you.

LENINA
Oh, good.

FANNY
But dignified. That's the best word.
